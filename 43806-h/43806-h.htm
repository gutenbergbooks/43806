<hr class="l15" />

<h2 class="chap1">CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="s08">A BRITISHER'S THREAT.</span></h2>

<p>In the year 1780 there was in North Carolina,
west of Broad River, and near the site of what
is now known as Rutherfordton, a settlement
called Gilbert Town.</p>

<p>Within five or six miles of this village on a
certain September day in the year above mentioned,
two lads, equipped for a hunting trip,
had halted in the woods.</p>

<p>One was Nathan Shelby, a boy sixteen years
of age, and nephew of that Isaac Shelby whose
name is so prominent in the early history of
North Carolina; the other, Evan McDowells,
son of Colonel Charles McDowells, was one
year younger than Nathan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>But for the fact that these two lads were sorely
needed at their homes, both would have been
enrolled either among the American forces, or
with those hardy pioneers who were then known
as Mountain Men, for the time was come when
the struggling colonists required every arm that
could raise a musket.</p>

<p>On the previous month the American forces
under General Gates had been defeated by
Cornwallis at Camden. Tarleton had dispersed
Sumter's forces at Rocky Mount, and the southern
colonists appeared to have been entirely
subdued by the royal troops.</p>

<p>General Cornwallis, now at Camden, was
bending his efforts to establish the king's government
in South Carolina, and in punishing
those "rebels" who, despite their many reverses,
were yet among the mountains awaiting a favorable
opportunity to strike another blow in
behalf of freedom.</p>

<p>It was at this time, and especially in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Carolinas, as if the attempt to free the colonists
from the oppressive yoke of the British had
utterly failed, and even the most sanguine
despaired of being able to accomplish anything
in that section until General Washington should
lend them some assistance.</p>

<p>Nathan and Evan, lads though they were,
understood full well the situation of affairs, and
as they sat upon the trunk of a fallen tree,
resting from the labor of seeking food&mdash;for this
hunting trip had been made for serious purposes,
rather than in pursuit of sport&mdash;the two
spoke concerning the reverses which had been
visited upon the patriots.</p>

<p>"It is as if we were already whipped into
submission," Evan said sadly, "for how is it
possible our people shall gather in such force
as to be able to offer successful resistance?"</p>

<p>"That seems indeed true," Nathan replied,
"and yet will Colonel William Campbell of
Virginia remain idle? Do you believe my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
uncle, Colonel Shelby, or Lieutenant-Colonel
John Sevier, have laid down their arms? Or
even if those three are subdued, is it likely,
think you, that your father will rest content
while the king's forces overrun the country at
their pleasure?"</p>

<p>"There are matters which cannot be mended,
however brave men may be, and it seems to me
that now has come the time when we must say
that the struggle for liberty can no longer be
continued."</p>

<p>"If all who have for four years opposed the
king's will were as faint-hearted as you, Evan,
then indeed had the rebellion been crushed before
it was well begun."</p>

<p>"But tell me, Nathan, how may the Americans,
with but few men, scanty equipments, and
little or no money, even attempt to hold their
own against the royal forces, which outnumber
us mayhap ten to one?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot do, and perchance even your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
father might find it difficult to make reply to
such question, but this much I believe to be a
certainty. The desire for freedom has not been
crushed out from the hearts of the American
people, and while it remains strong as at present,
some way will be found whereby we shall have
at least the semblance of an army again."</p>

<p>"I would I could believe you."</p>

<p>"Is your mother thus despondent?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say, Nathan. It is now near two
weeks, as you know, since I have seen her."</p>

<p>"But think you she has lost all hope? She,
who has dared to burn charcoal in the fireplace
of her own home, while the Britishers were
about, in order to carry it to your father, who
was making gunpowder in a cave among the
mountains."</p>

<p>"My mother is brave, which is more, mayhap,
than can be said for her son."</p>

<p>"Ay; had she not been, when your father's
cattle were driven off by the British skirmishers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
she had hardly called the neighbors together,
and by such show of strength recovered the
property. With women like your mother, and
men such as your father and my Uncle Isaac, I
tell you, Evan, the cause of liberty is not lost."</p>

<p>"But it would seem as if we were further
from our purpose now than four years ago, when
a declaration of our independence was read
throughout the colonies. Then we had more
money, and it was not as difficult to find recruits.
Now ten dollars in paper is hardly
worth two cents&mdash;in fact, I am told that even
the troops consider it too cumbersome for its
value to repay them for carrying it around."</p>

<p>"That is the case only with the paper
money."</p>

<div class="figcenter p2"><a name="i-016" id="i-016"></a>
<img src="images/i-016.jpg" width="345" height="557" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"You are grown timorous indeed, Evan, if you can imagine that noise to be
caused by the Redcoats."&mdash;<a href="#Page_7">Page 7</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"Ay, Nathan; and as for gold and silver, we
still trust to that on which is stamped the king's
image. But it is not for you and I to talk of
political matters, when both are really in the
same way of thinking; the only difference between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
us is that I, who was never so courageous
as you, have grown faint-hearted."</p>

<p>Evan ceased speaking very suddenly, for at
that instant both the lads heard the hoof-beats
of horses in the distance, and started up in what
was very like alarm as they listened, while exchanging
inquiring glances.</p>

<p>"It must be that the British are coming this
way," Evan said, turning as if to flee; but his
companion clutched him by the arm, saying with
a laugh:</p>

<p>"You are grown timorous indeed, Evan, if
you can imagine that noise to be caused by the
redcoats. Surely there are none nearabout
here, and even though there were, it is not likely
they would attempt to make their way through
this wood."</p>

<p>Evan ceased his efforts to flee, but turned as
if unwilling, with a forced smile upon his face.</p>

<p>"Of course it must be as you say, Nathan,
for the Britishers would have no business here;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
yet it is even true they may be nearabout, for
we have heard that General Cornwallis was
bent on sending a force into this section, and he
is not wise who refuses to take heed of any
warning in these times."</p>

<p>"You need not set me down as one who makes
light of the information which has been brought
by those whom we could trust; but I refuse to
be alarmed without cause, and the idea that the
Britishers would ride into this thicket is&mdash;They
<i>are</i> redcoats! It is <i>I</i> who am playing the
fool by setting myself up as an authority on
those matters of which I know nothing!"</p>

<p>The foremost of a mounted band had come
into view, causing this sudden change in
Nathan's speech, and the two boys gazed in
alarm at the rapidly advancing horsemen, for
now was it too late to make any attempt at
flight. Both knew, from reports which had
been spread through the country, of outrages
committed among even those who were not in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
arms, what it might mean to fall into the hands
of the enemy, who were bent on subjugating
the country by any means, however harsh, and
they had good reason to expect brutal treatment
once they were caught in the clutches of the
king's troops.</p>

<p>Involuntarily the lads clasped hands. Although
armed, there was no thought in the
mind of either that resistance might be offered,
and indeed it would have been in the highest
degree foolhardy to have done other than they
did at this moment&mdash;quietly await that foe
from which escape was impossible.</p>

<p>Where they stood the forest was open and
free from underbrush, therefore while the troopers
were yet a quarter of a mile away they were
in full view, their red coats showing in vivid
contrast among the green leaves, and before the
advance squad were yet arrived at where the
boys were standing, the entire company could
be seen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>Fully two hundred men, a goodly portion of
whom were Tories, clad in the ordinary garb of
the country, and the remainder wearing the
king's uniform, made up the party.</p>

<p>Among the foremost of the riders was one
clad in the habiliments of a major, and from
what had been told by those who brought the
information of General Cornwallis' movements,
the boys knew at once that this must be Patrick
Ferguson of the Seventy-first Royal Regiment.</p>

<p>It was this officer who accosted the frightened
lads, by asking in a loud voice which had in it
much of menace:</p>

<p>"What are you two doing here armed?
Rebel spawn no doubt, who lie in wait to do
mischief when it may be accomplished without
danger to yourselves."</p>

<p>"We are out hunting, and if it please you,
sir, in order to get meat for the family," Nathan
replied, speaking stoutly, although he was inwardly
quaking with fear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me no lies or it shall go the worse with
you. How long has it been that you of the
Carolinas must search for food in the forests?"</p>

<p>"Since his majesty's troops overrode the
colony, quartering themselves upon those whose
store of provisions was already scanty."</p>

<p>"Be careful how you speak! I am not in a
mood to hear insolence from those who rebel
against their lawful king," and the major made
a threatening gesture, bending from his horse as
if he would strike the boys.</p>

<p>Evan stepped back a pace in fear; but
Nathan boldly held his ground as he asked
bravely:</p>

<p>"Think you, sir, that two lads like us may
do the king harm?"</p>

<p>Major Ferguson's face reddened with rage,
and motioning for one of the troopers to advance,
he said:</p>

<p>"Disarm and bind these insolent cubs who
dare bandy words with their betters. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
shall talk in a different strain before I am done
with them."</p>

<p>"Would you make prisoners of us who are
not soldiers?" Nathan asked even as the man
seized him by the arm. "Would you carry
away from their homes two boys upon whom a
family is depending for food?"</p>

<p>"Where are your fathers?" Major Ferguson
asked sharply.</p>

<p>"I have none," Nathan replied. "My mother
is a widow."</p>

<p>"And yours?" he continued, turning toward
Evan.</p>

<p>"Colonel Charles McDowells."</p>

<p>"As rank a rebel as lives in the Carolinas.
See that you bind them well, my man, for I
doubt not these two, innocent as they would
appear, have already had their fingers in the
rebel broth."</p>

<p>"Since you are bent on making us prisoners,
sir, it is useless to deny that we have done aught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
against the king, save it be a crime to perform
our share in feeding those dependent upon us."</p>

<p>"If those who make up the ragamuffin following
of <i>Mister</i> Washington could not depend on
such as you to provide for the women and
children, they might be forced to remain at
home where they belong, instead of hatching
treason, and I could then, perhaps, clear this
portion of the colonies of every male inhabitant
who is old enough to be of service in any capacity.
Before I have performed my mission
you of the Carolinas shall understand what rebellion
means, for it is my purpose to teach you
a lesson."</p>

<p>Having said this the valiant major turned his
horse that he might speak with some of his followers,
and the trooper who was bidden to disarm
and bind the lads had well-nigh finished
with the task.</p>

<p>Nathan and Evan were rudely searched, and
with such effect that even their spare flints were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
taken from them. Their hands were bound
behind their backs securely with leathern
straps; the fowling pieces and the scanty store
of ammunition were taken charge of by one of
the troopers, and he who had been detailed to
seize them stood as if awaiting orders of his
commander.</p>

<p>"Keep up a brave heart, Evan," Nathan
whispered courageously. "Do not give yonder
redcoated brute the satisfaction of seeing that
we are afraid."</p>

<p>"We are likely to be carried very far from
home, Nathan, and it may be that much suffering
is in store for us."</p>

<p>"Of that there can be little doubt; but no
good will come to us by showing the white
feather, for of how much weight, think you,
tears and prayers be upon such as our captor.
It would please him were we to give free rein
to our sorrow, and I am not minded he shall
have such gratification from me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>"But surely there is no reason why you
should anger him by bold speaking&mdash;that will
not avail us."</p>

<p>"No more than it would if we pleaded for
mercy, and there is much satisfaction to be
gained by depriving him of the pleasure that
would come with the sight of our tears. Hold
firm, Evan McDowells, as your father and your
mother would do were they in like situation,
and mayhap the time will come when this Major
Ferguson's grasp will be so far lessened that we
shall see a chance of slipping through his
fingers."</p>

<p>"I have little hope of any such good fortune,"
Evan replied, with a long-drawn sigh, and then
both the boys fell silent.</p>

<p>The horsemen had dismounted, and it was
evident that a prolonged halt would be made.</p>

<p>The major gave no further orders concerning
his prisoners, and the trooper stood guard over
them four or five paces away, giving no apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
heed to the conversation in which they had
been indulging.</p>

<p>During half an hour the situation remained
unchanged, and then came into view two hundred
or more men on foot, the greater number
wearing scarlet uniforms, the remainder being
evidently Tories.</p>

<p>At first glance the boys believed this last
body of Britishers had come by accident upon
the halting-place; but as the men exchanged
salutations with the members of the advance
party, it could be seen that they all formed one
company under the leadership of Major Ferguson,
and had been temporarily separated
because of the more rapid traveling of the
horsemen.</p>

<p>When another half-hour had been spent here
the order was given to resume the march, and
an officer in the uniform of a captain brought
word from the major to the man who was
guarding the boys, that he would be relieved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
from duty, one of the foot-soldiers taking his
place.</p>

<p>When the change of guards had been effected,
Nathan and Evan were ordered into line
midway of the column, and thus hemmed in on
every side they were forced to advance, traveling
with difficulty, and even pain, because their
arms were fettered.</p>

<p>As a rule, the men gave very little attention
to these young prisoners, save when one or the
other of the boys fell slightly in the rear, and
then a blow from the butt of a musket would
warn him that he must keep pace with the
remainder of the troop or suffer because of inability
to do so.</p>

<p>Now that the lads were completely surrounded
by foes, no conversation of a private nature was
possible, and in silence they marched on, with
ample food for unpleasant thoughts.</p>

<p>The only question in the minds of both was
as to the destination of this body of Britishers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
for there seemed little reason why so many men
should penetrate this mountainous portion of
the Carolinas, where there was no important
stronghold to be captured.</p>

<p>Until five o'clock in the afternoon the troop
advanced steadily, and then the foot-soldiers
were arrived at a small valley where the horsemen
had already apparently halted for the night.</p>

<p>Fires were kindled here and there; some of
the soldiers were engaged in cooking, others in
caring for the horses, and all so intent upon
making themselves comfortable that it was as
if the prisoners had been forgotten by everyone
save him who was charged with their custody.</p>

<p>When an hour had passed the lads were still
standing where they had been halted, and
Nathan said with a mirthless laugh:</p>

<p>"It looks as though we might be forced to
keep our feet until morning, for so nearly as I
can make out food has been served to all save
ourselves and our guard."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"I am counting on being relieved before
many more moments pass," the soldier said
petulantly, for Nathan had spoken so loudly
that he could not fail to hear the remark.</p>

<p>"And are we to be starved because we
neither wear red coats nor are willing to march
shoulder to shoulder with them?"</p>

<p>"It matters not to me what disposition may
be made of you, so that I am given an opportunity
of getting my rations," the soldier said,
and a moment later one of his comrades came
up, musket in hand, to relieve him.</p>

<p>To this last guard Nathan repeated his question
as to the probability of their being provided
with supper, and the soldier replied carelessly:</p>

<p>"I am not the quartermaster of this detachment,
and if I was I question whether much
time would be spent over such as you."</p>

<p>Then he fell to pacing to and fro, watching
his comrades as they lounged around the campfire;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
but all the while keeping close guard over
the two lads, who were so weary from the hunting
of the forenoon and the march of the afternoon
that it is questionable whether they could
have fled even if the opportunity presented
itself.</p>

<p>"I had expected to be ill-treated," Nathan
said with an assumption of carelessness to his
comrade; "but did not count on being starved.
It is a pity, since we were to be made prisoners,
that this gallant Major Ferguson could not have
come up after we had partaken of dinner, for it
seems as if many hours had passed since we ate
breakfast."</p>

<p>Evan was on the point of making some reply
to this mournful remark when from the distance
he observed a lad, who, coming directly across
the valley, was halted by the sentinels stationed
around the encampment.</p>

<p>"Look there!" he said, in a low tone of excitement.
"If I mistake not, it is Ephraim Sowers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
and what may he be doing here among the
redcoats?"</p>

<p>"It is as I have always believed," Nathan
cried, forgetting that the man who acted as their
guard could hear every word he spoke. "Ephraim
is neither more nor less than a Tory, and
I venture to say he comes now to give information
concerning our friends."</p>

<p>"It is not the first time he has met this detachment
of men," Evan added, "See! He speaks
now with one of the soldiers as to an old
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Who may say for how long he has acted
the spy? When it was told on the day before
yesterday that he had gold in his possession, I
would not believe it; but now it is plain to be
seen that there was truth in the statement, and
we can say how he earned it."</p>

<p>This Ephraim Sowers was the son of one who
claimed to be "a man of peace;" one who by
many a loud word had declared that he believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
it a sin to resort to arms, whatever the provocation,
and, living a near neighbor to the McDowells,
was in a position, if it so pleased him,
to give much of valuable information to the
enemy. Until this moment, however, there
had been no suspicion that he might be tempted
to play the part of spy, and his son's arrival at
this encampment told the boys as plainly as
words could have done how it was General
Cornwallis had reliable knowledge concerning
that portion of the colony, for he had given
good proof that he knew who among the inhabitants
favored the king or the "rebels."</p>

<p>Ephraim advanced leisurely, and with the
air of one who believes he is expected, until his
eyes rested upon the prisoners; then he started
suddenly, a flush as of shame came over his
face for the instant, and straightening himself
defiantly, he walked up with a vindictive smile
until he was within half a dozen paces of the
two lads.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>"I had thought that the sight of a redcoat
was so displeasing that it went against your
stomachs," he said tauntingly, "and yet I find
you hobnobbing with Major Ferguson's men."</p>

<p>"It seems that you know who commands
this detachment," Evan said sternly, forgetting
all his fears now in the anger he felt that this
lad whom he had once trusted should have been
all the while a Tory.</p>

<p>"I'll warrant you two know as much."</p>

<p>"Ay; but we are here as prisoners, and you
have come as a visitor&mdash;one who has seen these
men before, to judge from the manner in which
you accosted them."</p>

<p>"Well, what does that prove?" Ephraim
asked, an evil look coming into his eyes.</p>

<p>"It proves you to be a spy, and when we
shall make known what has been seen this
night, I am thinking neither you nor your peace-loving
father will find the Carolinas a pleasant
abiding place."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>"And I am thinking that when such rebels
as you have the chance to tell what has been
seen, the rebellion will have been crushed out,
for now that you are here, if my words go for
anything, you will not soon be set at liberty."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="s08">THE TORY'S PURPOSE.</span></h2>

<p>Until the moment when Ephraim Sowers
had revealed his true self by coming into the
British camp as a spy, neither Nathan nor Evan
had felt any grave anxiety regarding the future.</p>

<p>They knew full well that the redcoats were
not given to being friendly in their intercourse
with the so-called rebels, and that such persons
as they took were treated with roughness, if
not absolute harshness.</p>

<p>Such treatment as had previously been dealt
out to captured Americans the boys could endure
without a murmur, therefore there was no
painful anxiety regarding the outcome of the
matter; but when Ephraim Sowers appeared,
the situation of affairs seemed to be decidedly
changed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>Now that he had been recognized by these
two, the news that he was a Tory and in league
with the Britishers would be carried to all that
country roundabout where he lived, whenever
Nathan and Evan were set free.</p>

<p>It was only reasonable to suppose he had
some slight degree of influence in the camp,
having served Major Ferguson as a spy, and
these two lads might safely count on his doing
whatsoever was in his power to have them held
prisoners, even if worse did not follow, and it
was evident Nathan feared this last possibility,
for he said in a low tone to his comrade, when
the young Tory had walked away with a swagger
in the direction of Major Ferguson's tent:</p>

<p>"No good will come to us through having
seen that villain."</p>

<p>"On such a point there need be little discussion,
for I am of the same mind, and it will be
exceedingly fortunate if he leaves this encampment
without having worked us some harm,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
although I cannot say in what way it might be
done."</p>

<p>"For his own safety, should he ever count on
returning home, we must be silenced, Evan, and
I am thinking Ephraim Sowers knows in this
encampment enough of his own kidney who
would aid him in thus doing."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that he would dare to kill
us?" and now Evan looked up in alarm.</p>

<p>"He would dare do anything when there was
no danger of his receiving bodily injury. But
don't let me play upon your fears, for there is
no reason why we should look abroad for
trouble when we have sufficient of it close
around us. We will trust to the chances that
that young Tory is powerless, or too much occupied
just at present, to give evil heed to us."</p>

<p>"The last is what we should not take into
consideration, for however actively engaged he
may be it is necessary for his own safety, should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
he ever return among his neighbors, to prevent
us from telling what we have just learned."</p>

<p>"If you refuse such comfort as I try to give,
then we will put it that he will be content so
long as we are held prisoners here, and who
shall say that we may not soon find an opportunity
for escape? Captives while on the march
are not like to be kept under overly strict
guard."</p>

<p>"Where did the Tory go? I was so bewildered
both by seeing him here and realizing
what his coming might mean, as to be almost
in a daze while he was making his threats."</p>

<p>"I fancied I saw some one nearabout Major
Ferguson's tent beckoning for the scoundrel,
and he hurried away as if bent on visiting the
commander. I venture to predict we shall see
him again before he leaves this locality."</p>

<p>Then the lads fell to speculating as to how
long young Sowers had been engaged as a British
spy; what might be the result of Major
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Ferguson's march through the mountains, and
in other ways discussing the situation as if they
were to be spectators rather than participants in
whatever might occur.</p>

<p>When half an hour had passed, much to
their surprise, for the boys had come to believe
they would not be given food that night, rations
were served out to them, and they were partaking
of the limited meal with such keenness of
appetite and eagerness as to be unaware of
Ephraim Sowers' return until he stood close
beside them.</p>

<p>"Well, have you finished giving Major Ferguson
all the information he desired?" Nathan
asked curtly, only glancing toward the newcomer
sufficiently to discover his identity.</p>

<p>"I may have told him some things that
wouldn't be pleasant for you to hear," the Tory
replied surlily.</p>

<p>"Of that I have no question, for it is easy to
guess that you have done all the injury to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
your neighbors of which your tongue was
capable."</p>

<p>"I have given the major such a good account
of you two that he won't be likely to part company
with you for some time to come."</p>

<p>"We are not surprised, because it was only
what might have been expected after we found
you were playing the part of spy," Evan said,
determined to so far hide his fears that this
vicious enemy should not suspect what was in
his heart.</p>

<p>"I am ready to do whatsoever I can against
the enemies of the king," Evan replied, assuming
what he intended should be a dignified
attitude.</p>

<p>"His majesty must rest content now, if he
knows that you stand ready to aid his officers
by playing the spy upon those who have befriended
you when you were in need."</p>

<p>Nathan spoke distinctly and deliberately, in
a tone so loud that all might hear, and Ephraim's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
face crimsoned with mingled rage and
shame, for he knew full well that but for the
aid afforded him by Nathan's uncle during the
previous winter his sufferings might have been
great indeed.</p>

<p>"I shall do all in my power to overthrow the
wicked plans of the rebels, and more particularly
will I exert myself against the Mountain
Men," he cried, in a fury of passion, whereat
Evan added quietly:</p>

<p>"We can well fancy that, for Master Isaac
Shelby is a Mountain Man, and but for him
you would have starved. Let me see: vipers
have been supposed to be the only living things
that would sting the hand which feeds them."</p>

<p>"I shall sting you even worse than I have
already done!" Ephraim cried, shaking his
clinched hand in impotent rage, and so threatening
was his attitude that the soldier on guard
seized him, as if fearing the boy would strike
the helpless prisoners.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>"Take your hands off!" Ephraim cried, literally
trembling with passion. "I am not to be
treated as a prisoner in this camp after all I
have done."</p>

<p>"Very true," the soldier replied quietly.
"You shall not be deprived of your liberty save
when it becomes necessary to prevent you from
striking helpless captives, and that I would not
allow my own comrade to do."</p>

<p>"I had no idea of touching them."</p>

<p>"Your actions told a different story, and even
though these two lads be rebels, they shall be
treated decently while I am on guard over
them."</p>

<p>"I will see them hanged, and that before
long!" Ephraim screamed.</p>

<p>The soldier released his hold of the infuriated
Tory, but took the precaution of stepping directly
in front of Nathan and Evan, as if to
afford protection; while Ephraim, standing a
few paces away, poured out a flood of invective,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
during the course of which much information
was gained by those whom he menaced.</p>

<div class="figcenter p2"><a name="i-044" id="i-044"></a>
<img src="images/i-044.jpg" width="352" height="557" alt="" />
<p class="caption">"Take your hands off! I am not to be treated as a prisoner," Ephraim
cried.&mdash;<a href="#Page_32">Page 32</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"I didn't come to this place empty-handed!"
he cried, "nor will my visit be of little concern
to the rebels! I brought Major Ferguson information
that Clarke and his men are in camp
at Greene's Spring, and to kill and capture
them all will be a simple matter for this troop."</p>

<p>"You have dared bring the enemy down upon
your mother's own cousin," Evan cried in astonishment.</p>

<p>"He is no cousin of mine once he raises his
hand against the king."</p>

<p>"I'll venture to say there will be little desire
on his part to claim relationship after he knows
the part you have been playing," Nathan replied
with a laugh, which yet further increased the
Tory's wrath. "But have a care, Ephraim
Sowers. The men in this colony are not easily
whipped into submission, nor do they readily
forget an enemy, and if it should so chance, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
it has many times since '76, that the king's
forces were driven out of the Carolinas, your
life would not be an enviable one."</p>

<p>"If anything of that kind should happen, and
I am ready to wager all I possess it never will,
you won't be here to know what comes to me,
for before then I will take good care you are
put where all rebels should be&mdash;under the sod."</p>

<p>"If the king's officers will commit, or permit,
murder at your request, then must they give up
all claim to the name of soldiers," and now
Evan was rapidly becoming as excited as the
Tory. "It may be you can succeed in having
us killed; but the reckoning will come, Ephraim
Sowers, and the longer it is deferred the more
must you pay."</p>

<p>"I will settle with you first after my own
fashion, and when that has been done we will
see what your ragamuffin friends are able to do
about it."</p>

<p>Ephraim would doubtless have indulged in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
further threats, but just at that instant a soldier
came up from the direction of Major Ferguson's
tent, and the vindictive lad was summoned
to the commander's quarters.</p>

<p>"It seems that his footing here is not so secure
that he can give his tongue free rein many
minutes at a time," Nathan said in a tone of
relief as the spy walked reluctantly away, literally
forced so to do by the messenger who had
come in search of him.</p>

<p>"It is not his words which trouble me," Evan
said mournfully. "Just now he is in a position
to work us great injury, and by yet further
provoking his wrath we have made of him even
a more bitter enemy than he naturally was."</p>

<p>"I question if that could be possible."</p>

<p>"Yet you cannot dispute his power to work
us harm."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. If he be willing, as it appears
he has shown himself, to betray the
whereabouts of Colonel Clarke's forces, knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
full well that this troop can readily cut
them down, it is certain we stand a good show
of learning how great is his power for mischief."</p>

<p>"For myself I have little concern at this
moment, because of the knowledge that our
friends are in such peril."</p>

<p>"And yet there is nothing we can do to aid
them."</p>

<p>"Unless it might be we could escape." Evan
said suddenly, lowering his voice to a whisper
lest the sentinel should overhear his words.</p>

<p>"It is only needed that you look about in
order to see how much hope there is of such a
possibility," Nathan said despondently. "Even
though we were fresh, instead of so weary that
I question if we could travel a single mile
further, and if we might so far elude the sentinel
as to gain the cover of the thicket, it would
be impossible to continue the flight two miles,
for the Tories in this troop know the country
as well, if not better, than we."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"I was not so foolish as to believe that escape
might be possible, but only spoke because my
thoughts were with those who are threatened,
and my desire is to aid them."</p>

<p>"I wish it might be done," Nathan replied
with a long-drawn sigh, and then the two fell
silent, each occupied with his own gloomy
thoughts.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and nothing more had been
seen or heard of the Tory spy.</p>

<p>Even though they were in such desperate
straits, the boys began unconsciously to yield
themselves up to slumber, and after a time,
bound as they were, both were reclining upon
the green turf in at least partial repose.</p>

<p>When morning came they ached in every
limb, with arms so benumbed that it was as if
those useful members had been paralyzed.
They had slept fitfully, and were hardly more
refreshed than when the halt was called after
the day's march.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>Scanty rations were served out to them, and
to the intense relief of both the lads a captain,
more humane that his commander, ordered that
the bonds be taken from their arms.</p>

<p>They were to be tied together in such manner
that any attempt at flight would be useless,
and yet the labor of marching would be much
lightened.</p>

<p>The prisoners had expected another visit from
the Tory before the troop started; but in this
they were happily disappointed, and when the
march was begun they almost believed Ephraim
Sowers had been left behind, until shortly
before noon they saw him riding with the
mounted detachment.</p>

<p>"He is most likely guiding the force to
Greene's Spring," Nathan said bitterly. "He
counts on seeing those who have played the
part of friends to him shot down, and even
though their blood will be upon his head, he is
well pleased."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>To the relief of both the boys, their enemy
did not come near where they were, and it was
reasonable to suppose Major Ferguson, although
not prone to be overcareful of the feelings of his
"rebel" prisoners, had given Sowers orders to
put a check upon his tongue.</p>

<p>When noon came the detachment of foot soldiers
arrived at Martin Drake's plantation,
where the cavalry had already halted and were
actively engaged in wantonly destroying
property.</p>

<p>Outbuildings were torn down, lambs, chickens,
and geese were being slaughtered although
they were not needed for food, and the household
furniture which, rude though it was, represented
all that went to make up the interior of
the home, was thrown about the grounds, or
chopped into kindlings, from sheer desire to
work destruction.</p>

<p>The horsemen could not have been at this
place more than an hour when the foot soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
came up, and yet in that short time they had
completely wrecked the dwelling portion of the
plantation, and caused such a scene of devastation
as would lead one almost to believe that a
desperate conflict had raged at that point.</p>

<p>"All this must be pleasing to Ephraim
Sowers," Evan said bitterly, "for it was Martin
Drake's wife who tended him when he was ill
with the fever, and this may be a satisfactory
way of requiting her."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him since we halted?"</p>

<p>"No, and I am hoping he has gone ahead
with the advanced detachment, for it seems
certain all of the horsemen are not here."</p>

<p>Although Master Blake's live stock had been
slaughtered in such quantities that there was
treble the amount of food the troop could consume,
the boys were given nothing more than
cornbread for dinner, and hardly so much of
that as would suffice to satisfy their hunger.</p>

<p>Not until everything portable had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
destroyed, the doors torn from the house, and
the windows shattered, was the march resumed,
and then the prisoners heard the Tory who was
acting as guide say that at nightfall they would
camp on Captain Dillard's plantation.</p>

<p>There was in this information a ray of hope,
so far as warning Colonel Clarke's men of what
threatened, for Captain Dillard was in his command,
and if information could be conveyed to
the mistress of the house it was possible she
might send a message ahead.</p>

<p>This much in substance Nathan had suggested
to his comrade; but Evan failed to see
any possibility that good might be effected
so far as the friends of the cause were concerned.</p>

<p>"Even though Mrs. Sarah Dillard can be told
all that we know, it is not likely she will have
an opportunity of sending a messenger from the
plantation. Ephraim Sowers knows full well
where the captain may be found, and will warn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Major Ferguson against permitting any person
to leave the place."</p>

<p>"If Dicey Langston, a girl only sixteen years
old, could baffle Cunningham's band, who gave
themselves the name of the Bloody Scouts, as
she did on that night when alone she crossed
the Ennoree, swollen though the waters were,
what may Sarah Dillard do when she knows
her husband's life hangs in the balance?"</p>

<p>"It is not a question of what she would do,
but of what she can," Evan replied gloomily.
"Thanks to Ephraim Sowers, the commander of
this force will know only too well how eager
she must be to send news ahead of his whereabouts,
and will take precautions accordingly."</p>

<p>"That is as may be. We can at least hope
for the best," Nathan replied bravely, and then
word was given for the troop to resume the
march.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the British soldiery
came upon two plantations, the buildings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
which they utterly wrecked, shooting from sheer
wantonness the live stock that could not be run
down without too much labor, and seeming
eager in every way to mark their trail by destruction.</p>

<p>It was an hour before sunset when the boys
saw in the distance the buildings of the Dillard
plantation, and knew that the time was near at
hand when, if ever, they must get word to that
little band whose lives were in such deadly
peril.</p>

<p>Ephraim Sowers was nowhere to be seen; but
slight comfort could be derived from this fact,
for it seemed reasonable to suppose he was
making himself obnoxious in the dwelling of
those people whom he had once claimed as his
friends, but was now visiting as their bitterest
enemy.</p>

<p>"Keep your wits about you for the first opportunity
to gain speech with Sarah Dillard,"
Nathan whispered to his comrade, and Evan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
sighed as he nodded in reply, for it seemed to
him there was little chance they would be permitted
to hold a conversation with any acquaintance,
because of the probable fact that Ephraim
Sowers would guard against such a proceeding.</p>

<p>The prisoners were marched directly up to
the dwelling, and there, with the windows and
doors flung wide open, they had a full view of
the entire interior, but their enemy was nowhere
to be seen.</p>

<p>This, to Evan, unaccountable absence, troubled
him not a little, for he believed it betokened
yet more mischief on the part of the vindictive
Tory, but Nathan was not so ready to take
alarm.</p>

<p>"It may be that he is keeping out of sight,
hoping Sarah Dillard will still look upon him
as a friend, and, in case the captain should succeed
in escaping, confide the secret of his whereabouts
to him."</p>

<p>The mistress of the house was doing all in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
her power to satisfy the exacting demands of
the officers who had quartered themselves upon
her, as the boys could see while they remained
halted near the doorway.</p>

<p>It appeared that such servants as she had
were not sufficient in numbers to please these
fastidious red-coated gentlemen, and they had
insisted that Mrs. Dillard should perform her
share of waiting upon them. Now one would
call out some peremptory order, and then follow
it with a demand that the mistress of the house
give it her especial attention, while, despite such
insolence, Sarah Dillard moved with dignity
here or there, as if it were pleasure rather than
necessity which caused her to so demean herself.</p>

<p>On the outside roundabout the soldiers were
engaged in their customary diversion of killing
every animal which came within range of their
guns, and a huge bonfire had been built of the
corncribs, near which a score or more of men
were preparing the evening meal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>A spectator would have said that the dwelling
itself was spared only because in it the
officers had taken up their quarters, and once
they were ready to depart it would be demolished
as the other structures surrounding it had
been.</p>

<p>During half an hour or more the boys stood
close by the door under close guard, and then
one of the officers appeared to have suddenly
become conscious of their existence, for he called
in a loud tone to Mrs. Dillard:</p>

<p>"We desire of you, madam, some apartment
which will serve as a prison for two rebel cubs
that we have lately taken. Can the cellar be
securely fastened?"</p>

<p>"There is only a light lattice-work at the
windows, which might readily be broken out if
your prisoners made an effort at escape," Mrs.
Dillard replied.</p>

<p>"But surely you have some apartment which
will answer our purpose? If not, the men can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
speedily nail bars on the outside of one of the
chamber windows."</p>

<p>"There is a room above, the window of which
is already barred, that may serve your purpose,"
Mrs. Dillard said, as she glanced toward the
boys with a certain uplifting of the eyes, as if
to say that they should not recognize her as an
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Show it to me and we will soon decide if
that be what is required, or whether we shall
call upon our troopers to turn carpenters," the
officer said with a laugh, as if believing he had
given words to some witticism, and in silence
Mrs. Dillard motioned one of the servants to
lead the way to the floor above.</p>

<p>The brief survey which he made appeared to
satisfy the Britisher, for on his return he said
to Major Ferguson, who was seated at the head
of the table, giving his undivided attention to
the generous supply of food which the mistress
of the house had been forced to bring out:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>"There is but one window in the room of
which our fair hostess spoke, and that overlooks
the stable-yard; it is barred on the outside with
oaken rails stout enough to resist the efforts of
any three of our troopers, I should say. The
door can be not only bolted, but locked on the
outside, and in my opinion there should be
no need of a sentinel stationed inside the
building."</p>

<p>"If such is the case, why spend so much
breath in describing the dungeon," Major Ferguson
said with a laugh. "It is enough for our
purpose if the lads cannot break out, and the
sooner they are lodged within the sooner you
will be ready to hold your peace, thus giving
me an opportunity of enjoying this admirable
game pie. Put the rebels away and sit down
here, for it may be many days before another
such chance presents itself."</p>

<p>Word was passed to the soldier who had the
prisoners in charge for him to take them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the upper floor, and this trifling matter having
been arranged, the gallant British officers turned
their attention once more to converting their
hostess into a servant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="s08">A DESPERATE VENTURE.</span></h2>

<p>The meaning look which Mrs. Dillard had
bestowed upon the prisoners, brief though it
was, sufficed to revive their spirits wonderfully.
Not that there was any promise in it; but it
showed they were recognized by the hostess
and, knowing her as they did, the boys knew
that if there was a loophole of escape for them
she would point it out.</p>

<p>While preceding the soldier up the stairs it
was much as though they were guests in Sarah
Dillard's home, and there came with the fancy
a certain sense of relief and security such as had
not been theirs for many hours.</p>

<p>The apartment selected to serve as prison was
by no means dismal; it was cleanly, like unto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
every other portion of Sarah Dillard's home,
and sufficiently large to permit of moderate
exercise, with a barred window overlooking the
stable-yard which allowed all that took place
in the rear of the dwelling to be seen.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind being a rebel myself for a
few hours in order to get such quarters as these,"
the soldier said as he followed the boys into the
chamber. "Not a bad place in which to spend
the night."</p>

<p>"With a couple of blankets a body might be
very comfortable," Nathan replied in a cheery
tone, for despite the dangers which threatened
that little band at Greene's Spring, despite
Ephraim Sowers' avowed enmity and probable
ability to do harm, despite the fact that he was
a prisoner, this enforced visit to Captain Dillard's
house was so much like a home-coming
that his spirits were raised at once.</p>

<p>"And you have the effrontery to ask for
blankets after getting such a prison as makes a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
soldier's mouth water," the Britisher said with
a certain rough good-nature in his tone. "You
rebels have a precious queer idea of this sort of
business, if you can complain because of lack of
blankets."</p>

<p>"I am not complaining," Nathan replied with
a laugh. "Of course there is no situation which
cannot be bettered in some way, and I was simply
speaking of how this might be improved.
We are satisfied with it, however, as it is."</p>

<p>"And so you had better be, for I am thinking
there are not two rebel prisoners as comfortably
bottled up, and by this time to-morrow
night you will be wishing yourselves back," replied
the guard.</p>

<p>Then the soldier locked and barred the door
on the outside, trying it again and again to
make certain it could not readily be forced open,
and a few seconds later the sound of his footsteps
told that the boys were comparatively
alone for the time being.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>Now was come the moment when they should
make known the danger which threatened the
friends of freedom through Ephraim Sowers'
perfidy, for every second might be precious if a
warning message could be sent, and involuntarily
both the lads ran to the window, looking
eagerly out through the bars in the hope of seeing
some member of the household whose
attention might be attracted.</p>

<p>Major Ferguson's subordinates were not so
careless as to allow their prisoners many opportunities
of such a nature. All the servants, and
in fact every person on the plantation, was kept
busily engaged waiting upon the redcoats, a
goodly number of whom could be seen in the
stable-yards, which knowledge caused Evan to
say mournfully:</p>

<p>"We are not like to get speech with any one
who could carry word to Greene's Spring. It
stands to reason Ephraim Sowers has warned
the Britishers that such an attempt might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
made, and you may be certain, Nathan, no one
can leave the plantation without Major Ferguson's
permission."</p>

<p>"It is possible he can prevent a message
being carried; but I shall not give up hope yet
awhile."</p>

<p>"Before many hours have passed the troop,
or at least a portion of it, will set out to
slaughter our friends. I would I knew where
that Tory spy was at this moment!"</p>

<p>"Most likely he has gone ahead to make sure
his victims do not escape. We shall hear of
him again 'twixt now and daybreak."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," Evan replied with a long-drawn
sigh, and then, leaning his forehead
against the wooden bars, he gazed out longingly
in the direction his feet would have taken had
he been at liberty.</p>

<p>With two hours' start he might save the lives,
perhaps of a hundred men, all of whom could
be accounted his friends, and yet because of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
one lad's wickedness that little band of patriots
was in imminent danger of being massacred.</p>

<p>From the apartments below the coarse laugh
and coarser jest of a Britisher could be heard,
telling that the enemy were still bent on making
themselves as obnoxious to the inmates of
the household as was possible, while now and
then from the outside came sounds of the
splintering of wood or the cackling of poultry
as the soldiery continued their work of wanton
destruction.</p>

<p>Both officers and men grew more nearly quiet
as the shadows of night began to lengthen. The
Britishers were weary with asserting their pretended
right as victors, and the stable-yard was
well-nigh deserted of its redcoated occupants.</p>

<p>The young prisoners were standing near the
window in silence, when a slight noise as of
some animal scratching at the door attracted
their attention, and instantly the same thought
came into the mind of each.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah Dillard, freed for the time being from
the exacting demands of the unwelcome visitors,
had come, perchance, to point out some way of
escape.</p>

<p>Now was arrived the moment when they
might reveal to this brave woman the dangers
which threatened, and yet for the instant Nathan
hesitated so to do, because it appeared to him
that he would be distressing her needlessly,
since it was hardly probable she could find
means of conveying the warning to those in
peril. By making her acquainted with all that
threatened he would be doing no more than to
increase her distress of mind.</p>

<p>Evan, however, was not looking so far into
the future. He only realized that perhaps now
was the moment when he would make known
Ephraim Sowers' perfidy, and crept noiselessly
toward the door, whispering eagerly:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mistress Dillard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, boys, and I have come in the almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
vain hope that it may be possible to serve you,
although I know not how. When did you fall
into the hands of the enemy?"</p>

<p>"Have you seen Ephraim Sowers here?"
Evan asked, heeding not the question.</p>

<p>"No. Has he also been made prisoner?"</p>

<p>"It is far worse than that. He is a spy in
the service of the redcoats, and has revealed to
them the whereabouts of Colonel Clarke's
band."</p>

<p>"That is impossible, for the entire company
were here not more than eight hours ago, and
with them was my husband."</p>

<p>"Then the miserable spy is mistaken, and
these Britishers will have their journey for their
pains," Nathan whispered in a tone of intense
relief. "Ephraim has told Major Ferguson that
they were encamped at Greene's Spring, and
there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And it is to Greene's Spring they are going!"
Mrs. Dillard cried unconsciously loud.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
"How could any spy have learned of their
intended movements?"</p>

<p>"You must remember that Ephraim Sowers
has not been looked upon as a spy. Perchance
no one except the Britishers knew it until we
two saw him coming into the camp where we
were prisoners," and Nathan spoke hurriedly.
"It is not for us to speculate how our friends
have been betrayed; but to give the warning to
them without loss of time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dillard did not reply immediately, and
the prisoners could well fancy that she was trying
to decide how the danger might best be
warded off.</p>

<p>"Is it not possible for you to release us?"
Nathan asked after a brief pause. "If either
Evan or I were at liberty we might be able, by
rapid running, to cover the distance between
here and Greene's Springs before the redcoats
could arrive there, for it is not likely they will
start very early in the night."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"To escape from the window while the
soldiers are in the stable-yard is impossible,"
Mrs. Dillard replied, much as though speaking
to herself, "and as for getting you out by this
way I am powerless. One of the officers has a
key to the door, and even if it was in our possession,
there is little chance you could make
your way through the house secretly."</p>

<p>"But something must be done, and at once,"
Nathan whispered in an agony of apprehension,
and at that moment the sound of footsteps on
the floor below caused Mrs. Dillard to beat a
retreat.</p>

<p>The boys could hear the swish of her garments
as she ran through the hallway, and it
was as if the good woman had no more than
hidden herself from view before the heavy footsteps
of a man on the stairs told that some one
of the Britishers was coming to make certain
the prisoners were securely confined.</p>

<p>Creeping noiselessly away from the door lest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the redcoat should enter and find them in a
position which betokened that they had been
holding converse with some one on the outside,
the lads remained silent and motionless until
the noise of footsteps told that this cautious
Britisher, having satisfied himself all was as it
should be, had returned to the floor below.</p>

<p>Then the lads stole softly back near the door
where they awaited the coming of the woman
whom they hoped might show them the way to
freedom, even though at the time it seemed impossible
she could do so.</p>

<p>The moments passed like hours while she remained
absent, and then once more they heard
a faint scratching at the door which told of her
return.</p>

<p>"Tell me all you know regarding this boy
Sowers being a spy," Mrs. Dillard whispered
when she was once more where private conversation
could be carried on, and Nathan said
nervously:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"Why speak of him at a time when every
moment is precious? Instead of giving such as
that villain a place in our thoughts we should
be trying to form some plan whereby the lives
of our friends may be saved."</p>

<p>"It is yet too early in the night for us to
make any move," the brave woman replied as if
her mind was already made up to a course of
action. "Until the men have quieted down
somewhat we cannot so much as cross the yard
without being challenged, and I would know all
that may be told before setting out for Greene's
Spring."</p>

<p>"Do you count on making such a venture?"
Evan asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Some one must do it, and since I cannot set
you free, I must act as messenger."</p>

<p>"But there is hardly one chance in a hundred
you will succeed."</p>

<p>"Yet I shall try to take advantage of that
hundredth chance."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>"But how may you get there? It is twenty
miles over a rough mountain road."</p>

<p>"Even though it were ten times as far, and
the peril greater an hundredfold, do you not
think I would brave it in the hope of saving
the lives of those brave men?"</p>

<p>Evan ceased to find objections to her plan;
but asked how she might be able to make the
journey.</p>

<p>"There is in the stable a colt which the
Britishers will hardly attempt to drive away
because he has not yet been broken. I shall do
my best at riding him, and trust in the good
God for protection."</p>

<p>Nathan was not a cowardly lad; his acquaintances
spoke of him as one having much courage,
and yet he trembled at the thought of this
woman attempting to bridle an unbroken colt,
and then ride him twenty miles over the rough
mountain roads where only the steadiest of
horses might safely be used.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>He would have said something in the hope of
dissuading her from her purpose; but it was as
if his tongue refused its office, for Sarah Dillard
would ride that night not only to save a
hundred or more friends of freedom, but to save
the life of her husband.</p>

<p>"Tell me all you know of the spy, so that I
may warn our people against him with fair
proof."</p>

<p>Neither Evan nor Nathan made any attempt
at giving advice; the woman's courage so far
eclipsed theirs that it was as if she should command
and they obey&mdash;as if they had no right
even to offer a suggestion. Obedient to her
wishes they repeated all they had heard the
vindictive Tory say, and described in detail
his reception at Major Ferguson's camp.</p>

<p>"If you could only take us with you, or what
would be better, so manage it that we might go
in your stead," Nathan said when his account
of Ephraim Sowers was brought to an end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>"I would willingly do so if it might be possible;
but I can see no way to accomplish such
a purpose."</p>

<p>"Yet there are many chances against your
being able to ride the colt, however willing you
may be," Evan said, as if hoping such suggestion
might cause her to devise another means of
forwarding the warning.</p>

<p>"I know full well how many chances there
are against success, and yet because it is the
only hope, I shall venture."</p>

<p>But little conversation was indulged in after
this assertion, which seemed prompted by
despair.</p>

<p>Nathan told the brave woman all he knew
regarding the most direct path through the
thicket to the American encampment, and Evan
warned her to be on the alert for Sowers nearabout
the spring, where both he and his comrade
believed the spy had gone to make certain
his intended victims did not escape.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>Then all fell silent as if awed by the dangers
which were to be voluntarily encountered, and
presently the boys knew from the faint sounds
that Sarah Dillard had stolen swiftly away
without so much as a word of adieu.</p>

<p>"She will never be able to get an unbroken
colt out of the stable, even if she succeeds in
bridling him," Evan whispered, and Nathan
replied with a certain hopefulness in his tone,
although he was far from believing the venture
might succeed:</p>

<p>"It is possible the task may be accomplished.
I have more faith in her gaining the mastery of
the colt for a certain time than I have of her
being able to keep him on the trail. There are
many places 'twixt here and Greene's Spring
where a single misstep, such as an untrained
animal is likely to make, will send them both
into eternity."</p>

<p>As if by a common impulse the boys moved
toward the window, and there stood gazing out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
waiting for the appearance of the brave woman
who had not only to master an untamed horse,
but to keep herself concealed from view while
surrounded by enemies.</p>

<p>The troopers' steeds had been stabled in the
huge barns to the right of the dwelling, where
were kept the draft animals, and, as the boys
well knew, Captain Dillard's saddle horses and
the colt to which his wife had referred, were
housed in the small building directly across the
stable-yard from the improvised prison.</p>

<p>This particular portion of the plantation
appeared to be entirely abandoned by redcoats;
but the officers in the dwelling were so near at
hand that any unusual noise in or around the
yard would immediately attract their attention,
even though the sentinels were remiss in their
duty, and it seemed well-nigh impossible that
Sarah Dillard could so much as lead the
most steady animal out into the open without
betraying her movements to the enemy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"She won't be able to bridle the colt without
something of a fight," Evan said half to himself,
and Nathan added as if he would find some
ray of hope in the gloom which surrounded
them:</p>

<p>"It is fortunate that the stable has no floor,
and the colt may do considerable prancing
around without giving an alarm."</p>

<p>"Yet it is not likely she can ride him out
without a certain amount of noise."</p>

<p>"I know the venture is a desperate one,"
Nathan replied mournfully; "but I am forcing
myself to believe it may succeed."</p>

<p>At this instant a dark form was seen moving
cautiously around the corner of the house in the
direction of the small stable, and the boys knew
that the desperate venture was begun.</p>

<p>Although the night had fully come it was
not so dark but that surrounding objects could
be seen with reasonable distinctness, and from
the moment Sarah Dillard thus came in view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the prisoners were able to follow her every
movement.</p>

<p>No frontiersman could have made his way
across the yard with less noise than she did;
not so much as the breaking of a twig betrayed
her movements, and if this stealing out of the
house had been the only difficult part of her
task, then one might say she would accomplish
it readily.</p>

<p>The boys hardly dared to breathe as she came
from the shadows of the building, moving with
reasonable rapidity across the yard until she was
lost to view in the gloom of the stable, and then,
although no creaking of hinges betrayed her
purpose, both knew she had effected an entrance.</p>

<p>It was only the easiest portion of the work
which had been accomplished, however, and the
prisoners stood with every nerve strained to its
utmost tension as they listened for what would
betoken that the struggle with the untamed
animal had begun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>Once, just for an instant, they saw her form
at the door, and then she suddenly disappeared
as if the colt had pulled her back; but as yet,
even though on the alert, they could hear nothing
unusual, and unless the British officers grew
suspicious because of her absence, she was yet
in safety.</p>

<p>One, two, three moments passed almost as if
they were hours, and then the brave woman
could be seen fondling and petting the colt, who
already wore the bridle, as she peered out from
the doorway to learn if the coast was yet clear.</p>

<p>"She has bridled him, and without making a
noise," Evan whispered in a tone of astonishment.</p>

<p>"It was easier to do that in the darkness than
it would have been in the light, and if she is
wise she will mount inside, instead of trying to
do so out here."</p>

<p>It was as if Nathan had no more than spoken
when with a bound the colt, bearing on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
back the woman who was risking her life to
save her husband, came over the threshold,
rearing straight up on his hind feet until there
seemed every danger he would topple backward;
but yet his rider kept her seat.</p>

<p>"I had never believed a woman could do
that," Evan exclaimed in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this one might not have been able
to but for the necessity. It hardly seems possible
she can get out of the yard without detection,
for the sound of his hoofs as he rears and
plunges must of necessity bring the redcoats
out in the belief that their own horses have been
stampeded."</p>

<p>The colt struggled desperately to free himself
from the strange burden upon his back, and yet,
singularly enough, never once did he come down
upon the ground with sufficient force to cause
alarm. He alternately reared and plunged
while one might have counted ten, his rider
clinging to him meanwhile as if she had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
strapped securely down, and then with a bound
he cleared the stack of brush which was piled
just behind the stable, disappearing an instant
later amid the forest, which on this side the
plantation had been left standing within a
hundred yards of the dwelling.</p>

<p>"She is off, and headed in the right direction,"
Nathan said in a tone of amazement, as if
it was almost incredible the feat had been
accomplished, and the words were no more than
uttered before out of the house came trooping
half a dozen men, alarmed by the thud of the
animal's hoofs.</p>

<p>"They have heard her," Evan cried in an
agony of apprehension, "and now the chase
will begin, for they must understand what her
purpose is in thus running away."</p>

<p>Fortunately for the safety of that little band
at Greene's Spring, the Britishers were not so
well informed by the noise of all that had taken
place as Evan believed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>The thud of the colt's feet had simply caused
them to believe there might be a disturbance
among their own animals, and they were
very far from suspecting the real truth of the
matter.</p>

<p>They went hurriedly toward the barns wherein
their horses were stabled, however, and seeing
this both the boys believed that chase was
about to be given.</p>

<p>"If she can keep the colt straight on the
course, I have no fear they will overtake her,"
Nathan said, much as though speaking to himself;
"but it is not probable the beast will be
so tractable."</p>

<p>Now the prisoners watched in anxious suspense
to see the first of the troop ride out in
pursuit, and as the moments passed their spirits
increased almost to bewilderment because no
such move was made.</p>

<p>Finally, one by one, the redcoats returned to
the house as if satisfied everything was as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
should be, and Evan whispered, as if doubting
the truth of his own statement:</p>

<p>"It must be that they fail to suspect anything
is wrong. There is yet a possibility,
Nathan, that Sarah Dillard will accomplish the
task which half an hour ago I would have said
was absolutely beyond her powers."</p>

<p>"And if she can bridle and mount the beast,
I am tempted to believe she may reach Greene's
Spring in time, for certain it is that up to this
moment no one suspects that she has left the
plantation."</p>

<p>"I could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Evan ceased speaking very suddenly, and it
was with difficulty he could repress a cry of
fear, for at this instant the key was turned in
the lock, the door flung open, and as the prisoners
suddenly faced around, they saw before
them Ephraim Sowers, looking satisfied and
triumphant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="s08">THE STRUGGLE.</span></h2>

<p>The first and most natural thought that came
into the minds of the boys, as they turned to
see their enemy standing in the doorway, was
that he had discovered the flight, and, perhaps,
counted on doing something toward checking it
even now, when Sarah Dillard must have been
a mile or more away.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as this idea presented itself,
however, both realized that if the grinning
Tory had even so much as a suspicion of the
real state of affairs he would be urging the
troopers on in pursuit, rather than standing idly
there.</p>

<p>The young scoundrel remained for an instant
in the doorway enjoying his triumph, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Nathan found it difficult to repress a smile of
satisfaction as he saw the spy thus unsuspicious,
while Sarah Dillard was speeding toward
Greene's Spring to carry the warning which, if
told, would most likely save the lives of a
hundred men.</p>

<p>Ephraim, firmly convinced that nothing could
avert the fate shaped by him for Colonel
Clarke and his force, was enjoying the situation
as pictured in his mind, to the utmost of his
mean nature, and the boys almost forgot they
were prisoners in the pleasure born of the
knowledge that the Tory might yet be outwitted.</p>

<p>"What are you fellows doing over there by
the window?" Ephraim asked peremptorily
after surveying the two in silence fully a
moment.</p>

<p>"Have the Britishers any law or rule which
forbids one deprived of liberty from seeking
fresh air whenever he may be so fortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
as to get an opportunity?" Nathan asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"Hark you, Nathan Shelby, I am tired of
hearing your long-winded speeches, and we will
have done with them from this out&mdash;at least, so
long as I am the master."</p>

<p>"So long as you are the master!" Evan repeated
in a tone of contempt. "We haven't
been aware that such was the case."</p>

<p>"Then you may know it now for a certainty.
I am counting on you two trying to escape, and
therefore have come to stand guard in this
room."</p>

<p>"And a valiant guard you will be, Ephraim
Sowers, if your courage is no greater than it was
one year ago, when you fled in hot haste from
what proved to be a turkey-cock, thinking you
saw the head of an Indian among the weeds,"
Nathan said jeeringly, and the spy retorted
angrily:</p>

<p>"Have a care over your tongue, my bold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
rebel! Matters have changed now from what they
were forty-eight hours ago. You are among
those who obey the king, and do not allow
sedition-breeders free rein of their tongues."</p>

<p>"And now hark you, Master Sowers," Nathan
cried, losing his temper somewhat because of
the air of authority which this fellow assumed.
"'Rebels and sedition-breeders' are names which
have too much meaning in these days for you
to let them fall so trippingly from your tongue!
Have a care, you Tory sneak, lest even while
acting the part of guard over your betters, you
come to grief! I'm not minded to take many
threats from a coward and a spy."</p>

<p>"In this case, however, you will take whatsoever
I choose to give, Nathan Shelby, for it
needs only that I raise my voice to bring here
those who would shoot you down did you so
much as lift your hand against me."</p>

<p>"And it is such knowledge which makes you
so wondrous brave," Evan said with a laugh of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
scorn which did more to rouse the young spy's
anger than words could have done.</p>

<p>He struggled for an instant to speak; but
stammered and hesitated as the blood rushed
into his face until, losing the last semblance of
patience, he motioned for them to move back
toward the window from which they had just
come.</p>

<p>"If this is what you mean, we are willing to
take our stations here without your running the
risk of bursting because of your own sense of
importance," Nathan said as he moved back a
few paces, Evan following the example. "Have
a care, however, that you do not attempt to give
such orders as we shall be indisposed to obey, lest
it seem as if your authority amounted to nothing."</p>

<p>By this time Ephraim so far regained the
mastery over himself as to be able to speak, and
he cried in a fury:</p>

<p>"We'll soon see whether you dare disobey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
and to that end I will keep you busy for an
hour or more, until you have learned that I am
really the master. Now then, you rebels, remember
that the king's troops are near at hand
to shoot you down at the first sign of insubordination,
and take good heed to move exactly as I
command."</p>

<p>Ephraim straightened his body with a consequential
air, and stood for an instant as if
reflecting upon how he had best prove his
authority, while the two prisoners gazed at him
in astonishment that he should thus dare trust
himself unarmed alone with them.</p>

<p>"Stand straight and look me in the face!" he
commanded. "If the day's march was not
enough to break your spirits, we will see what
a little exercise will do for you now. Keep
step, and travel around this room until I give
you permission to stop."</p>

<p>"Do you think we are to be bullied by such
as you?" Nathan asked in great astonishment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>"If you think it is wise, refuse to do as I say,
and before five minutes have gone by you will
learn the result of disobedience."</p>

<p>Neither Evan nor Nathan moved, but stood
looking inquiringly into each other's eyes with
an expression on their faces which would have
warned the Tory of mischief had he been less
deeply occupied with his own fancied importance.</p>

<p>"Fall into line and march, or it will be the
worse for you!" he cried, advancing threateningly
with upraised hand until he was within
striking distance of the prisoners, and for an
instant it appeared as if he intended to inflict
punishment then and there.</p>

<p>Whatever idea may have been in his mind
cannot be said, yet it hardly seems possible he
would have attempted personal violence while
alone with those whom he had wronged, even
though the soldiers were so near at hand.</p>

<p>It is certain, however, the boys fully believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
he would carry out the implied threat, and
without thinking of the possible consequences,
or stopping to realize what might be the result
if this spy was roughly handled, as if with one
accord they leaped upon him, Nathan taking the
precaution of clapping his hand over the bully's
mouth at the first onset in such manner that
it was impossible for him to speak or make an
outcry.</p>

<p>Even a stronger lad than Ephraim Sowers
would have gone down before this sudden
attack as quickly as did he, and in a twinkling
the prisoners held him upon the floor in such
fashion that only one arm remained free.</p>

<p>Evan sat upon his feet, while Nathan, in addition
to covering his mouth, held his right arm
firmly.</p>

<p>With his left hand Ephraim struck out to
the best of his ability, but without accomplishing
anything whatsoever, and he was permitted
to thus thrash around, doing no harm to any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
save himself, until he had been thoroughly
wearied by the struggle.</p>

<p>"I reckon we have got time enough to
teach you quite a lesson," Nathan whispered
with but slight show of anger. "You are supposed
to be guarding us prisoners, and the redcoats
will give little heed to you for some hours
to come. While we are alone you shall get a
taste of what you would deal out to others."</p>

<p>As a matter of course Ephraim made no
reply, because it was impossible so to do; but
his captors could read in his eyes the threats his
tongue was powerless to utter.</p>

<p>"I know what you would say, my fine Tory
spy. You have in your mind the thought that
we must in time let you up, and then it shall
be your turn, for the soldiers will be called in
to perform what you fail in doing. How well
would that plan work if we did our duty, and
killed you here and now? It is what should be
done to a lad who, having received nothing but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
favors in this section of the colony, betrays to
their death a hundred or more of his neighbors."</p>

<p>Anger had rapidly died out of Ephraim's eyes
as Nathan spoke, for by the tone of the latter,
one would have said that he was in deadly
earnest, and really questioned whether or no it
was not his duty to take this worthless life.</p>

<p>"It would not be a hard matter to let his life-blood
out," Evan added, intent only on doing
his share toward frightening the spy, "and perhaps
it will be best even though he had not betrayed
Colonel Clarke and his men, for we can
have a very fair idea of what he will be, once
power is his."</p>

<p>"Find something with which to tie his feet
and hands, and then we will contrive a gag so
that it is not necessary to sit over him in this
fashion."</p>

<p>Evan obeyed the command by tearing from
the lad's hunting-shirt two or three strips of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
material sufficiently stout to resist all his
struggles, and in a comparatively short space of
time the Tory was bound hand and foot, with
one sleeve of his own garment stuffed inside his
mouth as a gag.</p>

<p>He was powerless now either to move or
speak, and only when the work was accomplished
did the boys fully realize that they had,
perhaps, injured themselves by thus temporarily
turning the tables.</p>

<p>"It would have been better had we let him
go his own gait," Evan said in a whisper as he
drew Nathan toward the window where the
helpless Tory could not overhear his words.
"Of course we cannot hope to keep him here
longer than morning, and it is hardly likely the
redcoats will suffer him to be absent so many
hours without making certain he is safe. Once
the troopers come we shall suffer for this bit of
pleasantry."</p>

<p>"They are not like to put in an appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
for several hours yet, more especially if the
villain gave out that he would stand guard
until weary of the sport."</p>

<p>"Yet the end must finally come."</p>

<p>Nathan started as if a sudden thought had
flashed upon him, and turned quickly toward
the window as he seized one of the heavy bars.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea that it might be possible
to pull that down?" Evan asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Hark you, lad," and now Nathan appeared
like one laboring under great excitement. "Why
might we not escape? The Britishers will have
no care for us while it is believed that sneak is
acting as sentinel, and if one of these bars could
be removed, we might count on at least an
hour's start."</p>

<p>"But there is no hope of our being able to
remove the barrier."</p>

<p>"Who shall say until it has been tried?"</p>

<p>"I am certain that with our bare hands we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
might tug and strain until morning without so
much as loosening one of the fastenings."</p>

<p>It was as if this suggestion excited Nathan
to a yet more brilliant flight of fancy in the line
of escape, for suddenly he darted toward the
door where he stood a moment in the attitude
of a listener, and then retracing his steps, whispered
to Evan:</p>

<p>"It is almost certain the Britishers are on the
floor below. This Tory has the key of the door
in his pocket&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely you are not thinking of attempting
to make your way down past all those who have
taken possession of the house?"</p>

<p>"By no means; yet what will prevent our
venturing into some of the chambers nearby,
where perchance we shall find what will serve
as a lever to remove these bars."</p>

<p>Evan seized his comrade's hands ecstatically.
There was every reason to believe such a venture
might be made, and without waiting to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
discuss it he began searching Ephraim's pockets
for the key.</p>

<p>This was soon found. A bulky iron instrument
fashioned by hand, and mostlike brought
from the mother country, it could not well be
concealed.</p>

<p>Cautiously, lest the slightest grating of the
iron should give the alarm, the boys shot the
bolt back; the door was opened, and they were
at last free of the upper portion of the house.</p>

<p>It was not safe to loiter in their work, however,
for at any moment some one might come
from below to ascertain what Ephraim was doing,
and the boys moved as swiftly as they did
noiselessly until, when hardly more than a
minute had elapsed, they had in their possession
such tools as it seemed positive would
enable them to effect the purpose.</p>

<p>An old musket barrel, and a strip of oak
which went to make up a quilting-frame, were
the articles which the lads brought into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
room, carefully barring the door behind them
and replacing the key in Ephraim's pocket.</p>

<p>These implements would serve to pry off the
bars of the window, but whether it might be
done silently or not was a matter that could
only be determined by experiment.</p>

<p>The helpless spy was watching their every
movement, and by bending over him now and
then the lads could see, even in the gloom, an
expression of anger in his eyes.</p>

<p>He must have realized now that the chances
in favor of their escape were brought about
wholly through his desire to gloat over those
whom he believed were in his power.</p>

<p>It can readily be believed, however, that the
two lads did not spend much time upon the
spy. Had there been a possibility of taking
him with them, they would have run many
risks in order to accomplish such a purpose; but
since that was out of the question, and he
powerless for harm during a certain time at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
least, they could not afford to waste precious
moments upon him.</p>

<p>"I will use this bar as a lever, and do you
stand by with the musket-barrel to hold such
advantage as may be gained," Nathan said. "It
is reasonable to suppose there will be some
creaking as the nails are forced out; but that we
cannot prevent."</p>

<p>"Work as cautiously as may be possible, for
we have ample time."</p>

<p>The lower bar was within three inches of the
window-ledge, and upon this Nathan determined
to direct his efforts, since it would probably be
the most easily removed.</p>

<p>The stout quilting-frame was inserted beneath
it edgewise, which brought one end some
distance into the room, the window-ledge serving
as a fulcrum.</p>

<p>Evan stood near at hand, ready with the
musket-barrel in case a shorter lever could be
used to better advantage, and, after listening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
for an instant to make certain that none of the
enemy were nearabout on the outside, the boys
began that work which it was hoped would
open the door to freedom.</p>

<p>Slowly and steadily the bar was raised upward
as the hand-fashioned nails bent under the
strain, and then came a creaking as the iron was
drawn through the wood; not loud, but sounding
in the ears of the anxious lads to be of such
volume that it seemed positive an alarm would
be given.</p>

<p>Both ceased their efforts, and stood near the
window listening.</p>

<p>No unusual sounds betokened that the redcoats
had heard the warning noise.</p>

<p>All was still save for the sounds of revelry
in the apartment below, and the hum of the
soldiers' voices nearabout the stables on the
other side of the dwelling.</p>

<p>"Try it again," Evan whispered with feverish
eagerness. "We have raised it half an inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
already, and as much more of a strain will leave
it in such shape that it can be readily pushed
aside."</p>

<div class="figcenter p2"><a name="i-104" id="i-104"></a>
<img src="images/i-104.jpg" width="347" height="557" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Nathan did as his comrade suggested, and save for a slight creaking now and
then, the work was carried on.&mdash;<a href="#Page_91">Page 91</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Nathan did as his comrade suggested, and
save for a slight creaking now and then, the
work was carried on in almost perfect silence
until the bar hung only by the points of the
nails.</p>

<p>It remained simply to force it outward with
their hands, at the same time preventing it from
falling to the ground.</p>

<p>With this removed, the aperture would be
sufficiently large to admit of their crawling
through, and the time had come, thanks to the
spy who would have taken their lives had his
power been sufficient, that they might follow on
the trail of Sarah Dillard to Greene's Spring,
if her mad ride had not led her to death
elsewhere.</p>

<p>"There is no reason why we should waste
any time here," Evan said hurriedly, nervous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
now that the moment for action had arrived.
"The redcoats may come at any moment to see
how their spy is faring, and it would be a grievous
disappointment to find ourselves checked
at the instant when it seems as if we were
freed."</p>

<p>"I have got just one word to say to that
Tory villain, and then I am ready," Nathan replied.
"Do you push off the bar, taking good
care that it does not drop from your hands,
while I warn him of what will surely be his
fate if he continues on the road he has
chosen."</p>

<p>Evan acted upon this suggestion as Nathan
kneeled by the side of Ephraim and whispered:</p>

<p>"You can have the satisfaction of knowing
that we would yet be fast prisoners but for
your having come to bully us. Until the
moment you threatened to strike I had no idea
escape would be possible; but the opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
has arrived, and we shall take advantage of it.
Now hark you, Master Sowers, and remember
all I say, for there be more than Evan and I
who will carry out this threat. Continue your
spying upon the Americans, serve the Britishers
longer, and you shall be marked for what
may be worse than death. When the life of
such as you is necessary in the cause of freedom
no one would hesitate to take it, coward and
sneak though you be. Turn about from your
ways this moment, or expect that the hand of
every Mountain Man and every American soldier
will be against you."</p>

<p>Ephraim twisted about as if it would have
pleased him right well could he have spoken at
that moment, but the gag choked his words, and
he perforce remained silent however much he
would have liked to use his voice.</p>

<p>Then all was ready for the flight.</p>

<p>The bar had been removed, and Evan stood
beside the window impatient to be off, fearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
each instant lest one of the enemy should ascend
the stairs.</p>

<p>"Go you ahead," Nathan whispered, "and if
when you reach the ground the redcoats appear,
do your best to make good your escape, thinking
not of me."</p>

<p>"I will never desert a comrade."</p>

<p>"You must in this case, if it so be opportunity
for flight presents itself. It is not your
life nor mine, Evan, which is of moment now.
We must remember only those who are in such
great peril, for I have many doubts as to
whether Sarah Dillard can force that colt over
the mountain road. Hesitate no longer; but
set out, and from this instant cease to think of
anything save that you are to arrive at Colonel
Clarke's encampment without loss of
time."</p>

<p>Thus urged, Evan delayed no longer than was
necessary, but a certain number of seconds were
spent in the effort to force his body through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
narrow aperture, because of the awkward position
which the circumstances demanded.</p>

<p>With Nathan's help he pushed his feet
through first, and when half his body was outside,
allowed himself to slip down at the expense
of severe scratching from the bar, which yet
remained in position above, until he hung by
his hands on the window-ledge.</p>

<p>"The distance is not great," Nathan whispered
encouragingly, "and you should be able to drop
without making much noise. Do not speak
once you are on the ground; but get behind
the smaller stable as soon as may be, and if in
five minutes I do not join you, push on toward
Greene's Spring alone."</p>

<p>"You will not delay?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as a minute. Now drop."</p>

<p>A slight jar, such as might have been made
by a child leaping from a height of ten feet,
was all that came back to the anxious listener
at the window to tell of his comrade's movements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and then he in turn set about following
the example.</p>

<p>Now it was that Ephraim made strenuous
efforts to free himself.</p>

<p>He writhed to and fro on the floor as if bending
all his energies to break the bonds which
confined his limbs, and so fearful was Nathan
lest the Tory spy should succeed in his purpose,
that he turned back to make certain the boy
was yet helpless.</p>

<p>"I am almost tempted to pay off the score
'twixt you and I before leaving; but it would
be cowardly to strike one who is helpless, I
suppose," the lad said half to himself, and then
turned resolutely, as if finding it difficult to
resist the temptation, setting off on the road to
freedom.</p>

<p>It was not as easy to force himself out between
the ledge and the bar as in the case of
Evan, because of his being considerably larger,
and the clothing was literally torn from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
back before he was finally in a position where
nothing more was required than to drop to the
ground.</p>

<p>It appeared to him as if he made double as
much noise as had his comrade, and before
daring to creep across the stable-yard to the
rendezvous agreed upon, he remained several
seconds on the alert for the slightest sound
betokening the movements of the Britishers.</p>

<p>No unusual noise came upon his ear, and
saying to himself that it was hardly possible he
and Evan had succeeded in making their escape
with so little difficulty, he pushed cautiously
forward until, when he was within the gloom
of the building, his comrade seized him by the
hands.</p>

<p>This was no time for conversation, nor was it
the place in which to loiter. Advantage must
be taken of every second from this instant until
they had carried the warning to Colonel Clarke's
men, or learned that Sarah Dillard had succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
in her ride, and Nathan pressed Evan's
hand in token that they should push forward
without delay.</p>

<p>The direct trail was well defined, and the
boys struck into it an hundred yards or more
from the stable, when Nathan whispered triumphantly:</p>

<p>"Now that we have succeeded in making our
escape, Evan, it is only a question of endurance,
and we must not think of self until after having
met Sarah Dillard, or had speech with Colonel
Clarke."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="s08">SARAH DILLARD.</span></h2>

<p>Nathan and Evan had good cause for self-congratulations.</p>

<p>The escape had been accomplished almost as
if the enemy themselves contributed to its success,
and so long as the two remained within
earshot of the plantation, nothing was heard to
betoken that their flight had been discovered.</p>

<p>Thanks to the fact that Ephraim Sowers had
taken it upon himself to wreak a little private
revenge simply because the lads had discovered
his true nature, the Britishers would rest content,
believing their prisoners were secure under
his guard, and it might be several hours before
any member of Major Ferguson's party had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
sufficient curiosity to inquire regarding the
young Tory's absence.</p>

<p>Unless, perchance, he was to act as guide for
the party who would march to Greene's Spring,
neither Englishman nor Tory would have use
for the spy before daylight, and it was quite
within the range of possibility that he might
remain gagged and bound upon the floor of the
improvised prison until the troop was ready to
resume the march next morning.</p>

<p>Once they were clear of the dwelling Nathan
and Evan wasted little thought on Ephraim.</p>

<p>When the time should come that they might
make known his true character among those who
had befriended the lad, then would they remember
him to some purpose; but while they were
pressing forward through the thicket at full
speed, now catching a glimpse of the footprints
of Sarah Dillard's horse, and again being convinced
that he had left the trail, it was as if
Ephraim had no existence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>Many times before the first three miles of
distance had been traversed did they speculate
as to the probable time when Major Ferguson
would send forward those men who were to
butcher or capture the little band of Americans
at the Spring; but without arriving at any
definite conclusion.</p>

<p>From the Dillard plantation to the encampment
concerning which Ephraim had given
information, was no less than twenty miles, and
in case the horsemen should be selected to do
the bloody work, about three hours would be
required for the journey.</p>

<p>If the foot-soldiers were chosen for the task,
then six hours would be none too long; but
neither of the boys believed the infantry would
take part in the proposed maneuver, otherwise
the men would most likely have set out before
dark.</p>

<p>"We can hold certain that the horsemen will
make the attack, and I am guessing they will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
not start before eleven o'clock to-night. They
may then fall upon our men between two and
three in the morning, when it is said sleep
weighs heaviest upon the eyelids, and if neither
Sarah Dillard nor we succeed in getting through
to give the alarm, there is little doubt but that
all under Colonel Clarke's command will fall
victims."</p>

<p>"We <i>must</i> get through," Evan cried with
energy, and Nathan added:</p>

<p>"We shall do it, lad; never you fear, for
there is like to be nothing that can stop us,
unless by some unfortunate chance the troopers
begin their journey before we have reckoned
on."</p>

<p>Then once more the boys trudged on in
silence until, perhaps ten minutes later, they
were brought to a sudden standstill by sounds
in the distance which seemed to proclaim the
movement of some heavy body through the
underbrush.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>Unarmed as they were, flight was their only
defence, and the two bent forward in the attitude
of listeners, keenly on the alert for the first
indication as to the character of this noisy
traveler.</p>

<p>At one moment Nathan would announce
positively that the disturbance was caused by
some animal, and again he felt equally certain
he could hear in the distance the sound of
human voices.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing of which I am fully
convinced," he said after being thus forced to
change his opinion several times. "Whoever
may be out there yonder is a stranger in this
section of the colony, otherwise he would be
more careful in proclaiming his whereabouts in
such fashion."</p>

<p>"In that case we may safely venture to creep
up nearer," Evan suggested. "So far as I can
make out, that disturber of the peace neither
lessens nor increases his distance, and we might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
wait here until the troopers come up without
being any the wiser."</p>

<p>To this Nathan agreed, and the two advanced
cautiously pace by pace until suddenly, and at
the same instant, a low exclamation of surprise
burst from the lips of both.</p>

<p>They had recognized Sarah Dillard's voice,
and knew without waiting for further proof
that her mad ride had come to a sudden and
untimely end.</p>

<p>Now the two pressed forward at a run, slackening
not the pace until they were where such
a view could be had of the struggling animal
and the courageous woman as was possible in
the gloom.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" she called, hearing the advance
of the boys, and there was a ring of alarm in
her tone which told that she feared the redcoats
might have pushed forward to make the
attack.</p>

<p>"It is Nathan Shelby and Evan McDowells,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the former cried, and gained some idea of the
good woman's surprise when she failed for a
moment to speak.</p>

<p>"Step out here where I may see you; but
take care not to further alarm the colt," she said,
distrusting the announcement even though she
recognized the voice.</p>

<p>The boys obeyed, and when Mrs. Dillard had
the proof of her own eyes as to their identity,
she demanded to be told how they had succeeded
in escaping.</p>

<p>"The Britishers must have left the plantation,
otherwise how could you be here?"</p>

<p>"If Major Ferguson's troop had gone we
should have been forced to accompany them,
else Ephraim Sowers has less influence than he
believes."</p>

<p>Then, without waiting for further questioning,
and in as few words as possible, Nathan explained
all, so far as he knew, that had taken
place at the plantation immediately after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
departure of Mrs. Dillard, asking as he concluded
the story:</p>

<p>"Was it not possible for you to keep the colt
on the trail?"</p>

<p>"He threw me when he got nearabout this
point; but I contrived to retain hold of the
bridle, and have kept him with me, although
thus far it has availed me little, since I am unable
to remount."</p>

<p>"Suppose you let either Evan or I ride him?
There will be less likelihood of his throwing
one of us."</p>

<p>"I question if you could come so near doing
it as I can, for he is acquainted with me, and
would not allow either of you to approach
him."</p>

<p>"I can ride any horse that another can
bridle," Nathan replied confidently, as he went
toward the colt, who during this brief conversation
had been standing comparatively quiet.</p>

<p>It was much as if he had heard the rash assertion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
and was determined to prove it false,
for the boy had no sooner begun to advance than
he reared and plunged in such a frantic manner
that Mrs. Dillard well-nigh lost her hold of the
bridle.</p>

<p>"It is useless for you to attempt it," she said
as soon as the animal had quieted down somewhat.
"He has been accustomed to no one but
me, and because I had been able to lead him by
the halter, did I venture to put on the bridle."</p>

<p>"There seems little chance you will be able
to mount," Evan said after a brief pause, "and
every moment increases the danger to those at
Greene's Spring. No one can say how soon
the Britishers may set out, and there are not
less than eighteen miles to be traversed."</p>

<p>"I know it," Mrs. Dillard cried like one
nearly frantic with apprehension. "I know it,
and yet what may be done? It is certain neither
of you boys can come as near managing the horse
as I, and yet, I am unable to remount."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you venture to lead him back?"</p>

<p>"To what end?"</p>

<p>"Evan and I might push forward on foot,
trusting to getting through in time."</p>

<p>"And there is little chance you could succeed,
lads. Eighteen miles over this rough road
would require certainly no less than six hours,
and before that time has passed the redcoats
must have overtaken you."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Dillard turned her attention to
soothing the colt, and during five minutes or
more the boys waited with ill-concealed impatience
as he alternately advanced to receive her
caresses, and then reared and plunged when she
attempted to throw her arm over his neck.</p>

<p>"It is better we push ahead, trusting to the
poor chance of arriving in time, than to stand
here idle," Nathan said at length. "I do not
believe you could force him to keep the trail
even though you succeed in remounting."</p>

<p>"It must be done," Mrs. Dillard cried sharply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
"There is no other means by which we may be
certain of warning those who are in danger,
and the colt shall be made to perform his
part."</p>

<p>"How can we help you?"</p>

<p>The anxious woman looked about her an instant
as if trying to decide how the task might be
accomplished, and then she said in the tone of
one who ventures upon an experiment:</p>

<p>"Suppose you two come up gently toward
him, one on each side, with the idea of seizing
him by the bridle. If that could be done, and
you were able to hold him a few seconds, I
promise to get upon his back."</p>

<p>"And perhaps only to have your brains
dashed out the next instant."</p>

<p>"There is no reason why we should speculate
as to the result. I must mount him, boys,
and he must be made to go forward. It is our
only hope, and when so many lives hang in the
balance it surely seems as if the good Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
would permit that I should do what at this
moment appears to be impossible."</p>

<p>Neither Evan nor Nathan believed they could
on foot traverse the distance which lay between
them and Greene's Spring before the Britishers
should arrive, and yet at the same time they
had little hope the restive animal would be
brought into submission; but at the moment it
seemed to be the only alternative, and without
delay they set about acting upon Mrs. Dillard's
suggestion.</p>

<p>Making a short detour through the bushes,
they came up on his flank, on either side, while
the animal reared and plunged until it seemed
certain he would shake off the woman's hold
upon the bridle. Then with a sudden dash
both boys gained his head at the same instant,
and this much of the work was accomplished.</p>

<p>Now the animal redoubled his efforts to escape,
frightened by the touch of strangers; but
the boys held bravely on, at times raised high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
from the ground, until it became a question as
to whether the bridle would stand the strain
which was put upon it.</p>

<p>"Don't let go," Nathan cried as the colt made
a more furious leap, forcing Evan to jump
quickly aside lest he be struck by the animal's
hoofs. "Don't let go, and we may possibly so
far tire him out that Mrs. Dillard can mount."</p>

<p>"She could not ride this beast even though
he was saddled," Evan muttered, now losing all
hope that the message might be delivered in
time.</p>

<p>During such while as the boys had been
struggling with the colt, Mrs. Dillard stood
dangerously near his flanks, watching for an
opportunity, and Evan had no more than uttered
his gloomy prediction when, clutching the
animal's mane with her left hand, she vaulted
on to his back, seizing the bridle as she
leaped.</p>

<p>"Now if you can head him up the trail, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
may let go," she said hurriedly; but Nathan
was not minded Captain Dillard's wife should
ride to what seemed almost certain death without
another protest from him.</p>

<p>"The colt is maddened by his struggles with
us, and in far more dangerous a condition than
when you first mounted. It is madness to
think of attempting to make your way through
the thicket in the darkness. I implore you to
give over the attempt, and let us press on as
best we may afoot."</p>

<p>"Now you are asking that I leave these brave
men, and among them my husband, to be surprised
by an enemy that knows no mercy, for it
is positive you could not get through in time.
Turn the colt, if it so be you can, and once he
is headed in the right direction, jump aside."</p>

<p>"Shall we do it?" Evan asked, for even now
it was in his mind to disobey the brave woman's
commands.</p>

<div class="figcenter p2"><a name="i-128" id="i-128"></a>
<img src="images/i-128.jpg" width="352" height="554" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The colt darted forward at full speed with Mrs. Dillard.&mdash;<a href="#Page_113">Page 113</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"Ay, I see no other course," Nathan replied,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
and then he devoted all his energies toward
carrying out her instructions.</p>

<p>Not less than five minutes were spent in the
battle between the boys and the animal, and
then the former were the conquerers so far as
having turned him around was concerned.</p>

<p>"Now stand ready to let him go, and leap
back out of the way," Mrs. Dillard cried.
"Then do you press on at your best speed in
case I am thrown again, and forced to give over
this method of traveling."</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" Evan cried.</p>

<p>"Ay, when you say the word."</p>

<p>"Let go!"</p>

<p>As the boys leaped back the colt darted forward
at full speed, wildly lashing out with his
hind feet, and in a twinkling the animal and
his rider were lost to view in the gloom.</p>

<p>"She will have earned Captain Dillard's life,
whether it be saved or not; but it will be at
the expense of her own, for there is not a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
in the Carolinas who can keep that beast on this
mountain trail."</p>

<p>"It would have been better if we had not
met her," Evan said gloomily, "for then she
would have been forced to go back, instead of
riding to her death as she is now doing."</p>

<p>To this Nathan made no reply, and while one
might have counted twenty the two lads stood
on the trail in the darkness as if there was nothing
more for them to do this night.</p>

<p>It was Evan who first aroused himself to a full
realization of the situation, and he said, much
like one who awakes from a troubled dream:</p>

<p>"It is not for us to waste precious time here,
Nathan. Believing that Sarah Dillard cannot
gain Greene's Spring, we must press forward at
the best of our ability, for there is a slight hope
we may arrive in time to give the alarm,
although it hardly seems possible at this
moment."</p>

<p>"You are right, Evan, and from this instant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
there shall be no halting," Nathan cried, as he
set out with a regular, swinging gait, which
promised to carry him at a speed of not less
than three miles an hour.</p>

<p>Now, being fully convinced that the safety of
Colonel Clarke's men depended entirely upon
themselves, they hastened onward without
thought of fatigue, making no halt save now
and then when they stopped to refresh themselves
with water from a mountain stream.</p>

<p>The gloom was now so dark that it was impossible
to distinguish any imprints on the
trail, and, consequently, the lads could form no
idea as to whether Sarah Dillard was yet keeping
in the direct course, or if the colt swerved
from one side to the other, carrying her amid
the underbrush, where she must inevitably be
killed. Until they believed midnight was
come Nathan and Evan had pressed steadily
forward, and then came that sound which told
them all their efforts were vain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>From the rear could be heard faintly the
sound of horses' hoofs, and involuntarily the
two halted.</p>

<p>"The Britishers are coming!" Evan whispered,
and Nathan's voice was tremulous as he
replied:</p>

<p>"They started even sooner than I feared, and
all our efforts are vain so far, for it is not less
than six miles from here to Greene's Spring."</p>

<p>"And our friends will be butchered!"</p>

<p>"There is hardly one chance in a hundred
but that the surprise will be complete, in which
case we know what must be the result."</p>

<p>They had ceased to believe in even the possibility
that Sarah Dillard might have accomplished
the journey in safety, and accepted
it as a fact that the plans of the enemy, laid on
information brought by Ephraim Sowers, would
be carried through successfully.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the horsemen until
the two lads could hear the hum of conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
among the men before they realized the necessity
of concealing themselves.</p>

<p>No good could be accomplished, so far as
those at Greene's Spring were concerned, by
their capture, and it was reasonable to suppose
much harm might come to themselves after they
were carried back to where Ephraim Sowers
might wreak his vengeance upon them.</p>

<p>Until this evening the young Tory had had
no cause for enmity save on account of their
having discovered his true character; but now,
after remaining gagged and bound a certain
number of hours, he must be panting for revenge,
and it might be that Major Ferguson
would not check him.</p>

<p>So long had they thus remained as if dazed
that there was hardly time to conceal themselves
in the underbrush a few feet distant from
the trail before the foremost of the horsemen
came into view.</p>

<p>The enemy were riding in couples, and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
his hiding-place Evan counted ninety pairs of
riders before the whole of the troop had passed.</p>

<p>Then it seemed as if fortune was determined
to play her most scurvy trick upon these two
lads, whose one desire was to save the lives of
their friends.</p>

<p>Evan, who had crouched on one knee when
he first sank behind the bushes, endeavored
to change his position in order to relieve the
strain upon his limb, and by so doing slipped
on a rotten branch, which broke beneath his
weight with a report seemingly as loud as that
of a pistol-shot.</p>

<p>Instantly the troopers halted immediately
opposite, and before the boys could have taken
refuge in flight, two having dismounted, plunged
into the underbrush.</p>

<p>All this had been done so quickly that the
fugitives literally had no time to flee, and hardly
more than thirty seconds elapsed from the
breaking of the twig until each lad was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
held roughly and firmly in the clutch of a
soldier.</p>

<p>"What's wrong in there?" an officer from the
trail shouted, and one of the captors replied as
he dragged his prey out into the open:</p>

<p>"We have found a couple of young rebels,
and they look much like the two we left behind
us at the plantation."</p>

<p>Word was passed ahead for the entire troop
to halt, and an officer whom the boys afterward
recognized as a Tory by the name of Dunlap,
who held the king's commission as colonel, came
riding back.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked as the troopers
forced their prisoners in front of them on
the trail where they might most readily be
seen.</p>

<p>"Nathan Shelby and Evan McDowells."</p>

<p>"How is it you are here? Are you not the
same who were taken prisoners this evening and
confined in the Dillard house?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>"We are," Nathan replied without hesitation.</p>

<p>"How did you escape?"</p>

<p>"Ephraim Sowers was sent, or came of his
own will, to make us march around the room
by way of punishment."</p>

<p>"No such orders as that could have been
given by Major Ferguson."</p>

<p>"I know not how that may be; but Ephraim
acted the part of jailer, and commanded us to
do his bidding, which was none other than that
we march around the room even though we had
been afoot all day."</p>

<p>"That doesn't explain how you escaped?"</p>

<p>"Ephraim was unarmed, but threatened to
strike us when we refused. The result was the
same as if almost any one else had been in our
position. We made Ephraim a prisoner, and
then, by forcing off one of the wooden bars,
slipped out of the window."</p>

<p>"Then the boy is yet there?" the colonel
said, as if in surprise that such should be the case.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, if he has not been released. We left
him safely enough."</p>

<p>Nathan believed that he and Evan would be
roughly treated so soon as that which they had
done was made known; but the troopers appeared
to think it a laughing matter, and even
the colonel who was in charge of the detachment
did not look upon it with any great degree
of severity, for he said after a brief pause:</p>

<p>"Ephraim must remain where he is until our
return, and perhaps after this night he will be
more careful when he puts himself into the
power of his enemies. You who have taken
the prisoners shall guard them until we have
finished our work, and then it is likely we will
have more to keep them company. Mount, and
see to it that the rebels do not make their escape
again."</p>

<p>The troopers obeyed, pulling the two lads
after them into the saddle, with many a threat
as to what would be the result if there was any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
resistance, until Nathan said, but without show
of temper or impatience:</p>

<p>"We are willing to ride, and shall not be so
foolish as to resist when the odds are so strongly
against us."</p>

<p>"We are not in the humor to put up with
any more rebel tricks this night, and at the first
show of an attempt to escape I shall use my
knife in a way that won't be pleasant," the
trooper replied as he put spurs to his horse, and
the detachment rode three or four miles further
before slackening pace.</p>

<p>Then they were come in the vicinity of
Greene's Spring, and the boys who had already
braved so much in the hope of being able to
warn their friends in danger, believed that the
time was very near at hand when they must perforce
see Colonel Clarke's men ruthlessly cut
down or captured.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="s08">GREENE'S SPRING.</span></h2>

<p>Many wild plans came into Nathan's mind
during the short time the main body of the detachment
were halted while skirmishers went
ahead to ascertain if Ephraim had correctly
described the situation of affairs.</p>

<p>It seemed to him at this moment as if he
must do something toward warning the friends
of freedom of the danger which menaced, and
was ready to act, whatever might be the cost
to him.</p>

<p>Once he said to himself that he would wait
until they were come nigh to the encampment,
and then he and Evan should cry aloud at the
full strength of their lungs, even though the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Britishers killed them an instant later&mdash;their
lives would count for but little if these others
who were so necessary to the colonists might be
saved.</p>

<p>A moment's reflection served to convince him
that such a plan was impracticable, and in casting
it aside he came to believe that possibly he
and Evan might succeed in getting hold of one
of the troopers' muskets sufficiently long to
discharge it.</p>

<p>Anything which would make noise enough
to arouse the sleeping men might answer his
purpose, and yet he racked his brain in vain to
hit upon that which should give promise of
being successful.</p>

<p>Neither he nor Evan had an opportunity for
private conversation. The two troopers held
the lads six or eight feet from each other, as if
suspecting they might plot mischief if allowed
freedom of speech, and therefore it was they
had no opportunity of comparing plans which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
had for their end only the welfare of Colonel
Clarke's forces.</p>

<p>At the expiration of ten minutes word was
passed along the line for the men to advance
slowly, and every precaution was taken as the
command was obeyed, to prevent even so much
as the rattle of their accoutrements, lest by such
means the Americans be apprised of the horrible
fate in store for them.</p>

<p>Soon the detachment was come within a quarter
of a mile, as nearly as Evan and Nathan
could judge, of the spot Colonel Clarke had
selected for the encampment, and now no man
spoke above a whisper.</p>

<p>"This is serious business on which we are
bent this night," the trooper who held Nathan
captive whispered threateningly, and standing
so near Evan that he also might overhear the
words, "and the lives of two boys like you
would not be allowed to come betwixt us and
our purpose. Therefore take heed, lads, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
our orders are to kill you in cold blood rather
than allow any alarm to be given. Now if it
so chanced that you struck your foot against my
musket, or shouted, or did anything to break
the silence, I should consider it my duty to
obey the commands, and as soon as might be
one or both of you would be past all danger.
Take an old soldier's advice, and make the best
of a bad matter. It is no longer possible you
can warn your friends, and the most you could
accomplish would be your own death."</p>

<p>There was little need for the trooper to make
this plain statement of the situation, for both
the boys understood full well how summarily
they would be dealt with in case they failed to
obey any orders given by the men.</p>

<p>Now whispered commands came down the
line for the soldiers to dismount, and for every
fifth trooper to remain in the rear to care for
the horses.</p>

<p>When this command had been obeyed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the animals tied with their heads together in
groups of five, it was found that the man who
held Evan prisoner was thus detailed to care
for the animals, while his comrade belonged to
the force which would advance.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that Nathan's captor turned
him over to the other trooper, saying as he
did so:</p>

<p>"If you have any doubts as to being able to
keep these young rebels in proper subjection, I
will truss them up before leaving; but it seems
to me one Englishman can care for five horses
and two boys, without any very great amount
of difficulty."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid but that it can be done
after some sort of fashion, yet I had rather not
kill a lad even though he be a rebel, so if it is
all the same to you, pass a couple of those
saddle-straps over their arms, and I'll be more
certain of keeping them here without using a
bullet."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>The trooper did as he was requested, and the
boys were fettered in such a manner as precluded
all possibility of escape.</p>

<p>With both arms stretched to their sides flight
was out of the question, and the hearts of the
lads were heavy in their breasts, for they must
remain in the rear while the redcoats went on
to do the slaughtering.</p>

<p>"I could kill Ephraim Sowers and never believe
I had committed a murder," Nathan whispered
when the two, placed back to back, were
fastened to a convenient tree. "All the blood
spilled this night will be upon his head, and
that brave men should meet their death
through such as him makes it all the more
pitiful."</p>

<p>"There is a chance Sarah Dillard succeeded
in getting through to the Spring," Evan whispered
in a tremulous tone.</p>

<p>"I cannot believe it. The captain himself
would never have made such a doubtful venture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and surely a woman could not succeed where he
must have failed."</p>

<p>Now those of the troopers who had not been
detailed to the care of the horses, were ordered
forward, and soon only the animals, with perhaps
twenty men to guard them, remained in
this portion of the thicket.</p>

<p>Not a sound betrayed the movements of the
redcoats as they advanced to do what seemed
little less than murder.</p>

<p>Even the boys, knowing how many were
making their way through the underbrush,
listened in vain for the slightest noise which
should tell of the progress. A band of Indians
could hardly have moved more stealthily, and
unless the members of the little encampment
were already on the alert, the doom of all was
sealed.</p>

<p>The suspense of the boys became so great as
the moments passed that they could not carry
on a conversation. Speculations were vain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
when in a few seconds the dreadful reality
would be upon them, and their hearts beat so
violently that it was as if the blood must burst
from their veins.</p>

<p>The seconds passed like moments, and yet all
too swiftly as the lads realized what time must
bring to their friends.</p>

<p>It seemed to Nathan as if they had remained
there silent and motionless fully an hour listening
for the first sound of the conflict, or the
massacre, whichever it might be, and yet all
was as silent as when the troopers left.</p>

<p>He began to fancy that both Sarah Dillard
and Ephraim Sowers had been mistaken in
believing Colonel Clarke's men were encamped
at the Spring, and when this thought had grown
in his mind until it was almost a well-defined
hope, the first musket-shot rang out.</p>

<p>"The murderers have begun," he said to his
comrade in a voice so choked by emotion that
the words sounded strange and indistinct.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a volley&mdash;a second and a third,
and the troopers who held the horses started in
astonishment, perhaps fear, for this was not the
absolute surprise on which they had counted.</p>

<p>Now the rattle of musketry increased until
there could be no question but that it was a
conflict, and not a massacre, which was taking
place.</p>

<p>By some means the patriots had been warned
in due season, and were ready to meet the foe,
as they ever had been.</p>

<p>"It is Sarah Dillard's ride that has saved
them!" Evan exclaimed as if questioning the
truth of his own statement, and straightway
Nathan fell to weeping, so great was the relief
which came upon him as he realized that the
friends of freedom had been prepared for the foe.</p>

<p>The troopers nearabout the boys were so
excited and astonished, because what they had
counted on as being a complete surprise proved
to have been a failure, that no one heard Evan's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
remark, and the prisoners could have shouted
for very joy when the men began speculating
one with the other as to how word might have
been sent to the patriots.</p>

<p>"It is certain they were ready to receive us,"
one man said as if in anger because the plan was
miscarrying. "That firing is being done by
men who were ready for battle as were ours.
There has been a traitor in the camp."</p>

<p>"How might that be?" another asked fiercely.
"At the last halting-place we were twenty
miles from the rebel encampment, and certain
it is no one could have ridden ahead of us."</p>

<p>"These two boy did succeed in escaping,
despite the fact that Major Ferguson believed
them to be safe in the chamber of the dwelling."</p>

<p>"Ay; but what does that prove? We overtook
them on the way, and surely you cannot
claim that they might have walked twenty
miles from the time of escaping until they were
recaptured?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>The rattle of musketry increased, and to the
eager ears of the boys it seemed as if the noise
of the conflict was approaching, which would
indicate that the Britishers were being driven
back.</p>

<p>"Does it appear to you as if we heard those
sounds more clearly?" Nathan asked, hoping
he had not been mistaken, and yet feeling almost
certain the patriots could do but little
more than hold their own.</p>

<p>"I am positive of it!" Evan cried with a
ring of joy and triumph in his tone. "Now and
then I can hear voices even amid the tumult,
and that was impossible five minutes ago."</p>

<p>One of the troopers, overhearing this remark,
said to his comrade gloomily:</p>

<p>"The rebels are getting the best of us, who
counted on taking them completely by surprise."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of that," the other soldier
replied, and straightway the men began making
the horses ready for departure, as if they expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
their comrades would come back in full
flight, and need the means of continuing it.</p>

<p>When five minutes more had passed there
was no longer any question as to the result of
the combat.</p>

<p>By this time the British were so near where
the horses had been left that now and then stray
bullets whistled among the branches above the
heads of the prisoners, and the two lads began
debating how it might be possible for them to
escape when the troop should be in full flight.</p>

<p>However kind Fortune had been to the Americans
on this night, she was not so indulgent as
to give the lads their liberty.</p>

<p>As could be told from the rattle of musketry,
the British made a stand after fifteen minutes'
or more of hot fighting, and the Americans,
having accomplished as much, and, perhaps,
even more than they had expected, were willing
the invaders should draw off if such was their
disposition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>In less than half an hour from the time they
set out to massacre the supposedly sleeping encampment,
the redcoats had returned, and, standing
by their horses, awaiting the command
to mount. Now it was that even in the gloom
the boys could see how many of the animals
were without riders.</p>

<p>There had been no empty saddles when the
troop rode up, and now on looking around there
was hardly a squad of horses where more than
two out of five had a man standing by his side.</p>

<p>"The slaughter was not wholly among our
friends," Evan whispered to Nathan, and the
latter, bent only on trying to escape, said
hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Think of nothing but yourself just now.
There must be a chance for us to give them the
slip amid all this confusion."</p>

<p>He had no more than spoken before one of
the officers came up and asked of those standing
near by:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>"Who had charge of these lads?"</p>

<p>The two troopers who had made the capture
replied to the question, and then came the
order:</p>

<p>"See to it that you hold them fast. There
is no reason why your own beasts should carry
double while there are so many spare horses;
but lash them firmly to the saddles, for Major
Ferguson must have speech with them by daylight."</p>

<p>"We are to suffer because the Britishers have
been repulsed," Evan whispered, and Nathan
replied manfully:</p>

<p>"Much can be endured, knowing as we do
all that has taken place this night. While I
am not hankering to come into the power of
Ephraim Sowers again, as most like we shall, it
will be less painful now this bloody plan has
gone awry."</p>

<p>Considerable time was spent before the remnants
of the detachment began the return march.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>There were many wounded to be cared for,
and a number so badly injured that they must
remain behind. Some of the dead were to be
buried, and the soldiers who had fallen nearest
the encampment must have the last office
performed for them by those whom they would
have massacred.</p>

<p>Finally all was in readiness.</p>

<p>Nathan and Evan, each on a trooper's horse
with his feet tied beneath the saddle, were given
a place just in advance of their captors and
about midway of the troop.</p>

<p>Colonel Dunlap and his officers set out in
advance.</p>

<p>The command to "march" was given, and the
crestfallen redcoats turned their faces toward
Captain Dillard's plantation.</p>

<p>Now it was impossible for the prisoners to
speak one with the other; during four hours
they endured a most painful journey, bound in
such manner that their limbs became cramped,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
and it was as if all the blood in their bodies had
been forced toward their heads.</p>

<p>The lads were hardly conscious during the
last hour of that painful march, and when,
arriving at the plantation, the ropes were unloosed,
they would have fallen to the ground
but for the assistance of those who guarded
them.</p>

<p>Ephraim Sowers was awaiting the return of
those who had gone out because of the information
he brought, and he gave vent to a loud cry
of vindictive joy when he saw them bringing
the two he most desired to see.</p>

<p>He was near at hand when the prisoners
reeled helplessly in the saddles, and as they
were laid upon the ground the young spy
advanced as if to kick them; but was forced
back by one of the soldiers, who said sharply:</p>

<p>"None of that, you young renegade. We
who wear the king's uniform are not a band of
painted savages; but men who fight fairly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
never disgrace themselves by striking a helpless
or an unarmed man."</p>

<p>"These rebels belong to me. I was in charge
of them when they escaped, and shall work my
will on them!" Ephraim cried in a rage as he
attempted to force himself past the soldier.</p>

<p>"Not while I am standing nearby, unless you
have Major Ferguson's written permission, and
that I much misdoubt you will get."</p>

<p>It was useless for Ephraim to insist that these
lads were his special property, and after learning
that some of the men looked with favor
upon his intention of torturing them as punishment
for their having escaped, he went post
haste to the commander.</p>

<p>Some of the redcoats had given the prisoners
water, and in a short time they revived sufficiently
to be conscious of all that was going on
about them.</p>

<p>It was at the moment Ephraim returned that
they sat upright, and to their surprise he made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
no attack upon them, but contented himself by
saying threateningly:</p>

<p>"Before this day comes to an end I will have
got even with you for last night's work, and
you may be certain I shall settle the score with
full measure."</p>

<p>"Since you failed in sending death to those
at Greene's Spring, we can well afford to listen
to your threats," Nathan replied, and then refused
to so much as look toward the spy.</p>

<p>From the fact that Ephraim lingered nearby
it seemed positive he must have received some
promise regarding the custody of the prisoners
from Major Ferguson; but yet as the time
passed he made no effort to interfere with them,
and when the detachment had been at the plantation
an hour or more, a messenger came with
orders that the two lads be taken into the house,
where the commander would have speech with
them.</p>

<p>"Now has come the time when we shall see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
how far that Tory sneak may be allowed to go,"
Nathan whispered to his comrade. "Do not
give him the satisfaction of knowing that we
suffer, whatever he may find an opportunity of
doing."</p>

<p>"I shall keep my thoughts on Sarah Dillard's
ride and its result, and then all pain will be
blunted," Evan replied, after which the two followed
limpingly (for the blood was not yet
circulating properly in their veins) the messenger
who had come for them.</p>

<p>Major Ferguson, Colonel Dunlap, Captain
Depuyster, and four or five other officers were
in the dining-room of Captain Dillard's home
when the boys entered, and from the conversation
which was being had at that moment
Nathan believed they were discussing the question
of how Colonel Clarke might have been
warned.</p>

<p>This supposition seemed to be correct when
the major asked abruptly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>"After you lads escaped from this building,
did you meet any one on the road to Greene's
Spring?"</p>

<p>For an instant Nathan hesitated to tell that
which was a falsehood; but it must be done unless
he would betray the woman whose brave
ride of the night previous had saved so many
lives, and there was only the slightest pause
before he replied:</p>

<p>"From the time we got away from Ephraim
Sowers until your men recaptured us, we saw
no person save those who belonged to the plantation."</p>

<p>"When did you last see the mistress of the
house, Mrs. Dillard?"</p>

<p>"We saw her when we were taken upstairs."</p>

<p>"Did you have any further communication
with her?"</p>

<p>"She spoke with us while we were in the
room&mdash;she standing on the outside of the locked
door."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you swear that she did not enter the
room?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for if she had been able to do that
much, I have no doubt she would have aided
us to escape."</p>

<p>"Did you have no assistance when you got
out of the room which had been converted into
a prison?"</p>

<p>"None except from your spy, Ephraim Sowers,"
Nathan replied, and then he told of the
circumstances of the affair, showing that but
for the young Tory's vindictiveness the boys
would yet have remained in confinement.</p>

<p>"Will you swear that you sent no word to
Colonel Clarke's forces?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," both the lads replied at the same
instant, and with such emphasis that there
could be no question but that they were telling
the truth.</p>

<p>Then the officer questioned them concerning
where they would have gone but for having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
been overtaken by the troopers; inquired concerning
their families, and such other seemingly
unimportant matters, to all of which they gave
truthful replies.</p>

<p>Perhaps twenty minutes had thus been spent
when Major Ferguson turned his head from
them as if the interview was at an end, and
Nathan, with a mind fully made up to make
known the threats in which Ephraim had
indulged, asked:</p>

<p>"Is it to be, sir, that the boy who would have
ill-treated us when we were supposed to be
powerless, will have an opportunity now to take
his revenge?"</p>

<p>"Who gave you to understand anything of
the kind?"</p>

<p>"He himself, sir. He has already boasted
that we shall suffer for what we did to him,
although it was no more than one soldier might
do to another. He was in our power, and we
could have abused him; yet we stayed our hands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
save so far as to put him in such condition that
an alarm could not be given."</p>

<p>"I ought to have you hanged offhand."</p>

<p>"But we have done nothing, sir, save to escape
from one who would have tortured us."</p>

<p>"You are rebels, and that is sufficient reason
why you merit death; but there is work I would
have you do, and for that reason your lives will
be spared. I wish to send a message to all
those rebels round about who are now in arms
against the king, and if you swear to faithfully
repeat my words, you shall go free from this
plantation within an hour."</p>

<p>The boys could hardly believe their ears
were not deceiving them.</p>

<p>That they should be set free at so small a
price, and in face of all the threats Ephraim
Sowers had made, was news so joyful as to be
incredible, and their astonishment was such that
neither made reply until the major asked impatiently:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well, do you refuse to do even that
much in order to earn your liberty?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we do not, sir," Nathan cried eagerly.
"We are willing to repeat whatsoever you desire,
and to as many as you shall say, no matter
how far it may be necessary to travel."</p>

<p>"Are you acquainted with all the rebel leaders
hereabouts?"</p>

<p>"With nearly all of them, sir; and I promise
that Captain Dillard, Colonel McDowells, or
Colonel Campbell&mdash;all three gentlemen with
whom we have acquaintance&mdash;will put us on
the way to find those others in this section."</p>

<p>"And you swear faithfully to repeat every
word of the message I give you, to each of those
rebels who is in command of a dozen or more
men?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Mind, I am saying that you deserve to be
hanged; but at the same time I am in need of
messengers, and believe that even though you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
are among the enemies to the king, I can trust
you two."</p>

<p>"We will perform all that we promise, sir."</p>

<p>"And see to it that you do. I am sent into
this portion of the Carolinas by General Cornwallis
to crush the spirit of rebellion, and here
I shall stay until my work be finished. Therefore
if you lads attempt to play me false there
will come a reckoning, for we shall meet again."</p>

<p>"Even though we be rebels in the sight of
the king, we hold to our word, and that both
of us have given. We will swear to it in whatsoever
manner may be most convincing to you,
sir."</p>

<p>"I shall take your word, knowing that the
time will speedily come when I can punish you
to the fullest extent if you break it. Now say to
all the rebels in and about this section of the
colonies, even though you are forced to travel
many a day, that I have come from General
Cornwallis' army unhampered by any orders other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
than those to crush out the spirit of rebellion,
and that if they do not desist from their armed
resistance to the king's commands and take
protection under my standard, I will march my
army over the mountains, hang their leaders,
and lay waste their country with fire and sword."</p>

<p>These words he required the boys to repeat
for him twice over, and that done, he added:</p>

<p>"Remember what will be the result if you
attempt to deceive me. Now go, and see to it
that you rest not until the message be delivered
to all those in rebellion within a circle of fifty
miles. Captain Depuyster, will you take care
that they have safe conduct outside our line of
sentinels. If the boy Sowers chooses to follow
them in the hope of getting his revenge, it will
not be in my power to prevent him."</p>

<p>Then with a gesture Nathan and Evan were
dismissed, and they walked out of the room as
if in a daze, for it did not seem to them possible
they had thus been dismissed from captivity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="s08">AT WATUGA.</span></h2>

<p>Captain Depuyster, who had been charged
by Major Ferguson with seeing that the boys
were passed through the line of sentinels surrounding
the encampment, lingered behind for
a moment to speak with the commander, and
the newly-released prisoners were still in such a
maze of bewilderment at having been given
their liberty that they failed to realize there
might be necessity for a captain's escort.</p>

<p>They went out of the dwelling, past the sentinels
at the door in silence; it was as if neither
dared to speak lest the sound of his voice might
cause the British commander to reconsider his
determination.</p>

<p>Without so much as looking behind them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
learn if Captain Depuyster was following, for
as a matter of fact they hardly heard the command
which Major Ferguson gave relative to
their departure, they went straight from the
door toward the trail which led to Greene's
Spring; but before having advanced twenty
paces they were brought to a halt as Ephraim
Sowers stepped in front of them.</p>

<p>"Have a care you rebels!" the Tory cried
threateningly. "Don't get the idea that you
can run away whenever the fancy takes you,
for I am not to be caught at a disadvantage
every hour in the day, as I was last night."</p>

<p>"If we come in contact with you again there
will be more damage done than when we contented
ourselves with making you prisoner,"
Nathan said sharply. "Stand aside, or it will
be the worse for you."</p>

<p>Ephraim looked up in surprise that the prisoners
should have retained such an independent
bearing after their interview with the major, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
he counted upon their having been reduced to
abject submission. He was not to be frightened
by their threats, however, now that he was in
the open air with the redcoated soldiery all
around him; and instead of obeying Nathan's
command he brandished his fists as he cried:</p>

<p>"Get back to the house until I can learn what
is to be done with you."</p>

<p>"We will give you the information without
any necessity for your returning," Evan said
with a laugh, which only served to irritate the
Tory. "We have Major Ferguson's permission
to depart, and count on doing so without allowing
ourselves to be delayed by such as you."</p>

<p>"Major Ferguson's permission to depart!"
Ephraim repeated stupidly.</p>

<p>"Step aside, or we may be called upon to
put you out of our path with more force than
is agreeable."</p>

<p>"You lie when you say the major has released
you!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"Hark you, Ephraim Sowers; I am not
minded to get into a brawl hereabouts; but so
much as repeat that word, and I shall give no
heed as to the consequences," Nathan said
sternly. "You and I have a long reckoning to
be settled, and I do not desire to begin it now;
yet I shall if you are not choice of your words."</p>

<p>Ephraim looked from one to the other questioningly,
as if trying to decide how he might
best reduce these lads to the proper state of
submission, and then called peremptorily to a
soldier who was passing near by:</p>

<p>"Hello there! Here are two prisoners who
count on escaping by pretending that Major
Ferguson has given them permission to depart.
Come and take them in charge."</p>

<p>"Are these your orders, or do you repeat
some other's words?"</p>

<p>"Don't stop to talk; but lay hold of these
two rebels, lest by sheer boldness they succeed
in making off."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>"Best keep a quiet and civil tongue in your
head, youngster, for I am not minded to take
orders from one who does such dirty work as
you," the soldier said surlily, and passed on,
leaving Ephraim crimson with rage.</p>

<p>Near by where the boys had been halted was
a stack of muskets, and running quickly up to
them the Tory seized one, regardless of the
fact that by so doing he allowed all the others
to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Then, turning suddenly, he aimed the weapon
full at the two lads, crying as he did so:</p>

<p>"Wheel about, and march back to the house,
or I shall shoot. Don't think you can get the
upperhand of me as readily as you did last
night, for I am not minded to deal gently with
you now."</p>

<p>"Ho, there! Guard!" a voice cried. "Seize
that lad and let him be deprived of his liberty
until he has sense enough to keep in his own
station."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>The soldier who had refused to obey Ephraim
wheeled about suddenly upon receiving this
command from Captain Depuyster, who had
just come from the dwelling, and before the
young Tory was well aware of the change in
the position of affairs, he was being marched
toward the stables, the trooper's hand clutching
his collar so tightly as to render breathing a
difficult operation.</p>

<p>"You can go on now, and see to it that
you do not loiter, until you have repeated
Major Ferguson's words to the rebels round
about."</p>

<p>Once more the boys set their faces toward
Greene's Spring, and as they marched rapidly
away the captain followed them until they were
past the line of sentinels.</p>

<p>Then he turned on his heel, and the two who
had so lately been prisoners slackened not their
pace until a mile or more was traversed, when
as if with one accord they came to a halt, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
order to congratulate each other upon the
fortunate and unexpected turn of affairs.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to repeat here what they
said, for one can well fancy how extravagant
were their words and demonstrations of joy at
finding themselves free when it had seemed
positive they were doomed to a long term of
imprisonment, during which time Ephraim
Sowers might often play the part of jailer.</p>

<p>They hugged each other as if the thankfulness
in their hearts could be thus shown better
than by words, and laughed loud and long at
the discomfiture of the Tory spy, who had
counted so certainly on making them atone for
their treatment of him.</p>

<p>In fact, so elated were the lads that their
words as well as gestures were extravagant;
perhaps half an hour had thus been spent before
either bethought himself that it was necessary
they should push ahead with all speed, for
no rations had been served since the night previous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
and food was not to be obtained until
they were among friends once more.</p>

<p>Once the boys were well on the journey, and
after the first excess of joy had passed away,
both realized their extreme weariness.</p>

<p>The previous day was spent in marching.
No sleep had come during the night, and much
excitement had tended to increase their fatigue.</p>

<p>Now twenty miles must be traversed, without
food, before they could gain the needed rest,
and it is not strange that when another hour
passed they found it difficult to continue the
advance.</p>

<p>More than once Evan urged that a halt be
made for two or three hours, lest they should
not be able to hold out until the end; but
Nathan steadily refused to listen to any suggestions,
and they toiled painfully on, stumbling
here or staggering there, hardly conscious of
their movements.</p>

<p>It was as if in a dream that they finally saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
that band of Americans who had repulsed the
British forces a few hours previous, and then all
was a blank, for consciousness literally deserted
them.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day and all of
the following night the weary lads slept.</p>

<p>The sun was rising, and Colonel Clarke's men
were making ready for a change of camp, when
Captain Dillard awakened the lads by shaking
each gently by the arm, as he cried in a cheery
tone:</p>

<p>"Rise up, or sleep will wear your eyes out.
Unless I am much mistaken you are more in
need of food just now than of additional slumber,
and it is time you were stirring."</p>

<p>The boys sprang to their feet refreshed by
the long repose, and ravenously hungry, but so
eager were they to learn the particulars of the
combat which they had heard from the distance
that neither realized his need of food.</p>

<p>"You shall hear it all very shortly; but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
will be on full stomachs, for I am not minded
to have you starve yet awhile, and it is Sarah's
right to tell the story."</p>

<p>"Then Mrs. Dillard <i>did</i> get here in time?"
Nathan cried.</p>

<p>"Ay, lads, else were we like to have been
murdered while we slept. And a brave ride it
was; but I am not the one to tell it. Come
over by the fire, and after you have filled yourselves
up I will put you in the way to listen to
all which I know you are eager to hear."</p>

<p>Half an hour later, after they had literally
obeyed the injunction to "fill themselves up,"
the boys and Captain Dillard were pressing on
in advance of the American force, to the dwelling
where Mrs. Dillard had sought shelter, and
before noon they had arrived at their destination.</p>

<p>There was much to be told on both sides, and
as the quickest method of gaining the information
he desired, Nathan first explained how they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
had left the British camp, and gave all the
details of their advance from the time of parting
with Mrs. Dillard on the mountain trail.</p>

<p>Then it was his turn to act the part of listener,
and eagerly did he and Evan drink in the vivid
account of that night ride, and the combat
which ensued.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the colt recognized the uselessness
of struggling further against the determined
woman who was bent on riding him, for when
the boys had let go their hold he darted forward
straight as an arrow over the trail, and at full
speed.</p>

<p>There were many places where the narrow
road ran along the side of the mountain, when
a single misstep would have thrown him headlong
over the cliffs, and yet no mountaineer's
steed ever traveled with a surer footing, and at
so swift a pace.</p>

<p>Once only did he make any effort at throwing
his rider. Then, fortunately, it was in a valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
where there were no trees, and Sarah Dillard
was sufficiently expert an equestrienne to baffle
him.</p>

<p>During ten minutes or more the steed plunged
and kicked, and then, as if again becoming convinced
that he must carry the life-saving message,
he darted onward, slackening not the pace
until they were arrived in the midst of the
encampment.</p>

<p>The amazement of the patriots at seeing the
hostess from whom they had so lately parted
at such an hour, can well be fancied, and it may
also be readily understood that, having accomplished
the dangerous journey, Sarah Dillard
lost no time in making known the fateful news
which she brought.</p>

<p>One word was sufficient to these men who
were inured to hardships of every kind and
accustomed to face danger in every form.</p>

<p>Within five minutes after Mrs. Dillard's
arrival they were prepared to give Major Ferguson's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
force a warm reception, and so sure
were the men in their ability to hold the encampment
against the enemy, that a squad of four
was sent, as escort to the brave rider, a dozen
miles or more away where dwelt one in whose
fidelity to the Cause there could be no question.</p>

<p>The colt, so Captain Dillard said, had done
his share in saving the lives of an hundred men,
and he should be called upon to perform no
meaner work so long as he might live, than that
of bearing on his back the woman who had
literally taken her life in her hands when she
set out on that perilous ride.</p>

<p>As to the combat, the captain dismissed it
with few words:</p>

<p>"We were ready for the redcoats when they
came up, and had been for two hours or more.
When the horses were picketed our scouts
brought us word, and then it was only a question
of figuring in our own minds how long it
would take them to creep up on us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>"We could see the Britishers as they surrounded
the encampment; but never a man
raised his gun until they had their muskets at
their shoulders, and then we sent a volley
among them that mowed down a full half of
those in the front rank. I thought at the moment
that they would retreat without so much
as firing a shot, because of the astonishment
which must have come over them. Fancy,
every redcoat there felt certain in his own mind
that we would be taken wholly by surprise&mdash;that
they had simply to fire into a crowd of
sleeping men, and it would have staggered the
best of soldiers to have a shower of bullets sent
among them thus suddenly.</p>

<p>"They did give us a volley, however&mdash;perhaps
half a dozen of them during fifteen minutes
that passed from the time we first opened fire
until the last musket was discharged, and then
I can say truthfully that fully half their number
was left behind, for, as we figured it, not more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
than two hundred came out, and we found dead
and wounded ninety-eight. As for ourselves,
but one man was harmed by British lead, and
he got a bullet through his arm in such fashion
that he will not be off duty a single day."</p>

<p>"We have buried the dead, sent the disabled
over the mountains where they will be well
cared for, and now stand prepared to meet
Major Ferguson's force again. But tell me
what is the message which he charged you to
deliver to all the rebels within fifty miles?"</p>

<p>"We are to say to those who fight in the
cause of freedom, that Major Ferguson has come
from Cornwallis' army unhampered by any
orders other than those to crush out the spirit
of rebellion, and if you do not desist from your
armed resistance to the king's commands, and
take protection under his standard, he will
march his army over the mountains, hang your
leaders, and lay waste the country with fire and
sword."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>"The gentleman has considerable to say for
himself, eh?" and Captain Dillard indulged in a
hearty laugh. "I wonder if Major Ferguson of
the Seventy-first regiment thinks the men hereabout
are of such milk-and-water natures that
he can disperse them with a word. If I am not
mistaken he tried to lay waste Greene's Spring
with fire and sword, and got decidedly the worst
of the attempt. It may so chance that he will
fail the next time he tries the same game. However,
it is not for you to question his method of
making war until after you have paid the price
of your release. Get you gone as soon as may
be, lads, and we will utilize the gallant major's
paroled prisoners to the calling together of our
men, at the same time his threatening words are
repeated. You shall be supplied with horses,
and I will write down a list of those 'rebels'
holding command nearabout, so that each and
every one of them may be visited. Having
repeated the threat, you shall then say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Colonel Clarke has heard the message, and gone
on to Watuga, where he awaits the coming of
those who resist the king's commands. In other
words, lads, we will make Watuga a rendezvous,
and the time for all to be there is not later than
the 25th of September."</p>

<p>"Now get you gone, for there be many miles
of traveling, and many days to be spent ere
your mission is ended and you have the right
to call yourselves free lads once more. Ride
with all speed, and waste not an hour, for the
time has come when General Cornwallis shall
be taught a lesson, or I am mistaken in my
neighbors."</p>

<p>Thus it was that Nathan and Evan set off on
their long and devious journey with no more of
a halt than was necessary to relate their story
and hear that which Captain and Mrs. Dillard
had to tell.</p>

<p>To repeat in detail all their wanderings would
form dry reading, therefore let us simply recount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
what was done from that day until the
twenty-fifth of September, when, as Captain
Dillard had arranged, the patriots assembled at
Watuga.</p>

<p>They repeated Major Ferguson's message to
Colonel William Campbell of Washington
County, in Virginia, and he promised to join
the patriots with four hundred men.</p>

<p>They had speech with Nathan's uncle, Colonel
Isaac Shelby, who agreed to bring two hundred
and forty from Sullivan County in North Carolina.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel John Sevier, who received
them most hospitably, declared that he,
with two hundred and forty of his neighbors
from Washington County, in North Carolina,
would start at once for Watuga.</p>

<p>Colonel Charles McDowells, Evan's father,
returned answer that he, with an hundred and
sixty from the counties of Burke and Rutherford,
would join the force, and Colonel Cleaveland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
answered for three hundred and fifty from
the counties of Wilkes and Surry; but agreed
to join force with the other Americans somewhere
on the Catawba River.</p>

<p>Colonel James Williams urged that the force
march to the Cowpens, on Broad River in South
Carolina, where he would add four hundred
trained soldiers to the command.</p>

<p>It was not until the morning of the 25th of
September that Nathan and Evan completed
their work of repeating Major Ferguson's message
and summoning the mountain men to the
rendezvous.</p>

<p>Then they were free, so far as the British
officer could have any claim upon them, and
believed themselves entitled to a place in the
ranks by virtue of what they had done for the
cause.</p>

<p>Many miles had been traversed, some on
horseback, many in boats, and not a few afoot.
They were received everywhere with the utmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
hospitality, and perhaps never were two lads
shown more respect than they, because of the
fact that they were doing, and had done, the
work of men, although only boys.</p>

<p>They were justly proud on the day of their
arrival at Watuga, to be received by these sturdy
patriots like equals, and to be besieged on every
side with questions as to the general feeling
among the people of the districts which they
had visited.</p>

<p>Evan's father gave them a place in his troop,
and when some of the men insisted that the
boys should be allowed to play the part of officers
because of the particular and difficult
work they had performed, Colonel McDowells
replied:</p>

<p>"If it is the purpose of the lads to serve their
country, they can best do so with muskets in
their hands, but if they simply desire to parade
themselves before the people in fine feathers,
the Carolinas is no place for them. They had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
better go where they can have better fare and
more opportunity for admiration."</p>

<p>It troubled the boys but little that, after
having been intrusted with important business,
they were to have no more responsible part
than that of private soldiers, for they knew full
well that neither was fitted for a command, and
it sufficed that the privilege was given them to
serve the cause in howsoever humble capacity.</p>

<p>They were in the ranks on that 26th day of
September when the little force went out from
Watuga down the Catawba River, and by the
5th of October, when the patriots had arrived
at the Cowpens where Colonel Williams kept
his word by marching up with twenty men
more than he had promised, it was said among
the men as well as the officers that there were
no more promising soldiers in the force than
these two lads whose first experience in military
matters had been gained as prisoners.</p>

<p>During this time they made diligent inquiries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
of all who might have such information concerning
Ephraim Sowers, but without learning
anything whatsoever.</p>

<p>"Don't let that fret you, lads," Captain Dillard
said when they went into camp at the
Cowpens, and learned from the scouts that
Major Ferguson's force was encamped not more
than thirty miles distant near the Cherokee
Ford of Broad River. "Don't let that fret you.
Unless I am very much mistaken, we shall not
remain here many hours, for there is a council
of war being held, and from what I know of our
commanding officers, we shall give the gallant
major all the hot work he can desire. Then, if
your Tory spy be not weak-kneed, you will have
an opportunity of coming face to face with him,
for once we have met this gentleman who proposes
to lay waste our country with fire and
sword, we shall not leave him until after having
made the acquaintance of a goodly number of
his men."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>"But Ephraim Sowers is not a soldier," Evan
said with a laugh, "and I am of the opinion
that he is weak-kneed."</p>

<p>"Even then the chances are he yet remains
with Ferguson's troop, for hark you, lad, the
Tories have joined the major in such numbers
that hereabouts in the Carolinas are none left at
their homes. The spy must stick to his red-coated
friends whom he served so well, or have
a mighty lonesome time of it by himself. If I
had played his part, doing all in my power to
bring about the death of those who had befriended
me, I should make it my business to
keep ever within sight of a red uniform, lest
some of those whose death I had sought to compass
might fall upon me. You shall see
Ephraim Sowers and have a long talk with
him."</p>

<p>"You speak, Captain, as if there could be no
question of the result, once we are come up with
the force."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither is there, lad. We of the Carolinas
have each a home to protect, and so many
wrongs to avenge that there can be no backward
move on our part once the fight is
opened."</p>

<p>"How many men think you Major Ferguson
can muster?"</p>

<p>"In regulars and Tories from fourteen to
fifteen hundred."</p>

<p>"And our own forces?"</p>

<p>"Not far from seventeen hundred."</p>

<p>"Then we are the stronger?"</p>

<p>"Not so, Nathan, my boy. Did we number
two thousand the force would hardly be equal,
because of disparity of weapons. The king's
troops are well equipped, and they bring with
them muskets and ammunition in plenty for the
Tories who join them. We have only such as
each man can provide, and some of us so poorly
armed that half a dozen rounds would see the
powder-horns and shot pouches emptied. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
we are fighting for the cause, and they for the
King. In that you have the whole story, and
therefore this I say: When we come face to
face with Major Ferguson, as I believe we shall
within twenty-four hours, we will stay with him
so long that you will have ample time in which
to seek out this spy who would have compassed
the death of us at Greene's Spring."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="s08">THE PRISONER.</span></h2>

<p>Nathan and Evan were enjoying to the
utmost this conversation with Captain Dillard.</p>

<p>It is true they had seen him seldom since the
first greeting after Sarah Dillard's ride; but on
each occasion he had appeared much as if trying
to show the world that he had espoused
respect and admiration for these two lads.</p>

<p>This was particularly pleasing to the boys,
because Captain Dillard was one who was
choice of his associates, and it was often said
that "Dillard's friendship was given only to
brave men."</p>

<p>Nathan and Evan were proud at being seen
with this gallant Carolinian as if they were his
bosom friends, and when a messenger came from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Colonel McDowells summoning them to an interview
with the commander of the forces from
Burke and Rutherford, they were not well
pleased at being obliged to part company from
the man who among all the troops they most
admired.</p>

<p>With evident reluctance they rose to their
feet, and while walking toward Colonel McDowells'
quarters, Nathan said:</p>

<p>"I don't think we did any very gallant deed,
Evan, when we turned the tables on Ephraim
Sowers, or aided Sarah Dillard to remount the
colt. Neither have we done anything of which
to boast in repeating Major Ferguson's message,
or summoning friends of the cause to the rendezvous;
but yet because of all those adventures
have we been marked out before the
entire camp as lads with whom Captain Dillard
is pleased to hold conversation, and even though
we had suffered much, such a reward would be
sufficient."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"The captain believes we shall come up with
the Britishers within twenty-four hours," Evan
said, as if he had not heard his comrade's
remark.</p>

<p>"Ay, and it is said they are only twenty
miles away, eager to meet us."</p>

<p>"Then there is like to be battle."</p>

<p>"Ay; how else could it be when both sides
are ready to fight?"</p>

<p>"And shall you rejoice at finding yourself
standing musket in hand before the foe?"</p>

<p>"Of a verity I shall! Why not? Would
you avoid the encounter if it could be done
honorably?" and halting suddenly, Nathan
looked his comrade full in the face.</p>

<p>"It is a shameful thing for a lad to say, of
that I am well aware," Evan replied hesitatingly;
"but I grow timorous at the thought,
and have great fear lest I shall betray some
signs of cowardice."</p>

<p>Nathan laughed long and loud.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>"When Captain Charles McDowells' son, he
whose grandmother has proven herself on more
than one occasion to be as brave as the most
courageous men, speaks of showing cowardice,
there is reason for laughing."</p>

<p>"But I have never stood in line with soldiers
during the heat of battle, and fear much lest I
should shame my father."</p>

<p>"You never have done so yet, lad, and I will
answer for it that he has no cause to blush in
your behalf. Put such idle fancies from your
mind, and when the hour comes that we meet
Major Ferguson's force, never fear but that you
will be foremost among the friends of freedom."</p>

<p>Evan would have said more regarding this
sudden timorousness which had come upon him,
but for the fact that they were then arrived at
Colonel McDowells' tent, and the subject of the
interview for which he had summoned them
was so startling and unexpected as to drive all
other thoughts from the boy's mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>"You two, who claim the right to be called
soldiers, although never having marched in the
ranks until the day we left Watuga, know full
well that the Britishers are within thirty or
forty miles of us at this moment."</p>

<p>The colonel paused as if for reply, and Evan
said:</p>

<p>"We have heard it so spoken among the
men, sir."</p>

<p>"You understand, also, that we are like to
measure strength with them before many hours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"While I cast no discredit on your courage,
I am free to say that men who have had more
experience in this business will be of greater
service to us in time of battle than you lads."</p>

<p>"But surely, father, you won't say that we
shall not bear our share in the combat," Evan
cried, suddenly forgetting the fears of which he
had made mention to his comrade.</p>

<p>"It is not my purpose to prevent you from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
bearing your full share of danger, and in fact I
now propose to place you in a position more
perilous than, perhaps, would be your regular
stations in the regiment. I simply wish to explain
why I called upon you for a certain service,
rather than men who may be needed elsewhere."</p>

<p>The boys looked in bewilderment at the
colonel, trying in vain to understand the meaning
of this vague explanation, and after a brief
pause he continued:</p>

<p>"It has been proposed that we send out a
certain number of men to gain all possible information
regarding the strength and disposition
of the enemy. To such suggestions I have
argued that we could ill afford to spare even
two soldiers, and yet I know it is necessary we
should have such knowledge. Therefore have I
said to those who are associated with me in the
command, that we would hold those who had
already proven themselves, and send out such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
as yet had a name to win. The mission is one
of extreme danger, and requires most careful
work. If you lads shrink not from the task, I
would have you volunteer to set about it, for
this is a service to which I would not order any
person. Go, if you can, of your own free will;
but if the undertaking seems too dangerous, no
one shall taunt you for having refused."</p>

<p>"Where are we to go, sir?" Evan asked.</p>

<p>"As near to Major Ferguson's encampment
as may be necessary in order to learn exactly
the number and disposition of his men."</p>

<p>"When are we to start?"</p>

<p>"As soon as may be. There is no time for
delay, since we must push forward steadily, and
not allow it to be believed that we shrink from
the battle."</p>

<p>"Then it would be best Evan and I did not
spend any further time in asking questions,"
Nathan interrupted. "We will be off at once."</p>

<p>"And you have no hesitation about the matter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
young Shelby?" Colonel McDowells asked
as he gazed at the boys sharply.</p>

<p>"Both Evan and I are ready to do all that
may be in our power, and even though the
task was one which we shrank from, both of us
have too much pride to allow that fact to
become known. However, this doesn't seem
as dangerous as when we set out about
making our escape from the Dillard plantation,
and there is no reason why we should falter.
My only fear is lest we may not be sufficiently
well versed in military matters to bring such
information as is required."</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes and ears open, remembering
everything which is seen and heard, and I doubt
not but that you can perform the mission as well
as the ablest soldier among us. It is necessary
you exercise great prudence, however, for should
Major Ferguson detect you in loitering around
his encampment, he would be justified in hanging
you as spies with but scant ceremony."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you any further orders, sir?" Evan
asked nervously, for this reminder of the peril
they were about to incur was not pleasing.</p>

<p>"None," and the colonel rose to his feet as
he held out both hands to the boys.</p>

<p>A fervent hand-clasp was the only token of
parting, and the lads went directly from this
interview to prepare themselves for the journey.</p>

<p>Captain Dillard came up as they were refilling
the powder horns, and counting out an
additional store of bullets.</p>

<p>"So the colonel has sent his son rather than
risk the life of one of the men," he said half to
himself, and Evan looked up with a smile as
he replied:</p>

<p>"When favors are to be bestowed, captain, it
is right the father should remember first his
son."</p>

<p>"And this is a favor with a vengeance," Dillard
muttered, after which, realizing he had been
imprudent in thus voicing his apprehensions, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
whistled a cheery tune as if there was no reason
why he or any other in the encampment should
be gloomy.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes the boys had made
their preparations for the scout, and were debating
as to the best course to be pursued.</p>

<p>"Make straight for Cherokee Ford, lads, and
trust to luck for all the remainder. I do not
mean that you are to go blindly ahead without
taking due precautions; but it seldom pays at
such times to map out an elaborate plan, for
much depends upon accident."</p>

<p>Then the captain turned abruptly away, most
likely to avoid a leave-taking, and the two boys
marched side by side out of the encampment,
the men following them with their eyes but
speaking no word, for each understood upon
what a perilous venture they were embarked.</p>

<p>It was nightfall, and the young scouts were
unfamiliar with the country over which it would
be necessary to travel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>They knew, however, that a well-defined trail
led from the Cowpens to Cherokee Ford, and
along this they advanced at a smart pace, for it
seemed necessary the journey should be performed
during the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>Neither felt inclined for conversation. The
silence of the men as they left the encampment
struck them much like predictions of evil, and
they were weighted down by a sense of danger
in the air everywhere around them.</p>

<p>At near midnight they made the first halt,
and up to that time not more than half a dozen
words had been exchanged.</p>

<p>Now it was as if the nearness of the foe revived
their courage rather than depressed them,
and they discussed the situation as calmly as
they might have spoken of the most ordinary
affair.</p>

<p>"We must have been five hours on the march,
and covered no less than seventeen or eighteen
miles," Nathan suggested.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely we are that far from the encampment,
and it stands us in hand to have an eye
out for redcoats, because they or the Tories will
likely be scouting nearabout their halting
place."</p>

<p>"And by going blindly ahead we may come
upon them sooner than would be pleasant,"
Nathan added with a laugh. "Now it is my
proposition that we tarry here until daybreak,
rather than run our noses into trouble."</p>

<p>"Father said we were to perform the mission
as quickly as might be."</p>

<p>"True; but yet he did not propose that we
discover the foe by running into their very
midst."</p>

<p>"We are yet a good dozen miles from Cherokee
Ford, and by waiting here until daybreak
will be forced to spend three or four hours before
we can hope to see the main body."</p>

<p>"If it is your belief that we should push on
yet further, I am ready," Nathan replied in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
tone of content, and thus it was decided that
they should not make camp until having arrived
at least six miles nearer the supposed location
of the Britishers.</p>

<p>After fifteen minutes had been spent in resting
the lads set forward again, and, as nearly as
they could judge, it was two o'clock in the
morning when Evan announced that he was
ready to make a lengthy halt.</p>

<p>Creeping into the thicket a few yards from
the trail where they could remain concealed
from view, and yet be enabled to see any who
might pass, the boys set about gaining such repose
as might be possible.</p>

<p>One slept while the other watched, and every
half-hour they changed positions, so that by
daybreak each had had his share of slumber.</p>

<p>When the first grey light of dawn appeared
they set out for the final and most perilous stage
of the journey, advancing cautiously, halting to
listen at every unfamiliar sound, and oftentimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
making a detour through the thicket when
there was a sharp bend in the trail which might
have led them suddenly upon a scouting party
of the foe.</p>

<p>By such method their progress was exceedingly
slow, and by sunrise they had advanced
no more than three miles.</p>

<p>Now if the information brought to the
American encampment was correct, they were
close upon the Britishers, and might at any
moment expect to see a scarlet coat through the
foliage.</p>

<p>"We must take some chances in order to
push ahead more rapidly, or we shall not be
able to return before to-morrow morning,"
Nathan whispered impatiently, after they had
literally crawled through the thicket half an
hour more, and the words were hardly uttered
when the sounds of footsteps upon the beaten
path a short distance in advance of them, caused
both to suddenly seek a hiding-place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>It is well the lads were on the alert, for
within a few seconds four Britishers came down
the trail in a leisurely fashion, as if out for no
other purpose than that of a stroll, and Evan
gripped Nathan's arm hard as he saw in the
rear of these men none other than Ephraim
Sowers.</p>

<p>The young Tory was walking slowly, as if
displeased with himself for having ventured
away from the camp, while the Britishers were
in the best of spirits, laughing and chatting
merrily without paying any attention to their
gloomy-visaged companion.</p>

<p>It was when he arrived at a point directly
opposite the hidden scouts that Ephraim stopped,
leaned his musket against a rock, and seated
himself upon a fallen tree-trunk, as he said
petulantly:</p>

<p>"I am tired of this wandering around when
we are like to come upon a party of rebels at
any minute."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why do you follow? No person prevents
you from returning to the camp," one of
the soldiers said with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I am minded to go back alone, and you know
full well the orders were that no man should
stray very far from the mountain."</p>

<p>"Then you are not disobeying, since I'll go
bail there's little of the man about you."</p>

<p>"How dare you speak in that way when
Major Ferguson is nearby to overhear the
words?" and now Ephraim displayed anger.</p>

<p>"Don't pride yourself, lad, on being the
especial pet of the major. He is not given to
much affection for cowards, even though they
be spies, and I am willing to wager considerable
that no member of the command would be
reproved for speaking harshly to such as
you."</p>

<p>During this brief conversation the soldiers
had continued to advance, while Ephraim remained
sitting upon the log, and when the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
remark was made the redcoats were hidden
from view by the foliage.</p>

<p>The young Tory kicked idly at the earth in
front of him, looked up and down the trail as
if in search of something entertaining, and then
leaned lazily back against a convenient bush.</p>

<p>The footsteps of the soldiers sounded fainter
and fainter in the distance, telling that the men
were continuing to advance, until finally all was
silent.</p>

<p>The two lads were within forty feet of the
boy who would have done the cause of freedom
such grievous wrong, and each instant those
who might lend him a helping hand were drawing
further away.</p>

<p>Nathan glanced at Evan with a question in
his eye, and the latter understood it as well as
if he had spoken.</p>

<p>"It might be done," he whispered cautiously;
"but we should not neglect the work which
was set us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not safe to advance while these men
are between us and Major Ferguson's force,
therefore unless we make him prisoner it is
necessary to remain idle."</p>

<p>"What could be done with him?"</p>

<p>"I'll venture to say he might be frightened
into telling all we would know."</p>

<p>Nathan hesitated an instant. They had been
sent out solely to gain some knowledge of the
enemy's force and disposition. To take this boy
a prisoner, even though he was their bitterest
foe, seemed to be deviating from the course
Colonel McDowells had marked out, but yet,
as Nathan said, they must remain idle there until
these four men should return. Therefore it
would not be such a woeful waste of time.</p>

<p>"If we can do it without giving the alarm, I
am ready," Evan whispered, and instead of replying,
Nathan began creeping cautiously in
the direction of the Tory, who sat with his back
turned toward them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>Many a time had these two lads crept quietly
upon a flock of wild turkeys without alarming
the shy birds, and to go through the same
maneuvers when a dull boy like Ephraim
Sowers was the game to be stalked did not
prove difficult.</p>

<p>Side by side they advanced with hardly so
much as disturbing a single twig, and had gained
the cover of a bush within three feet of him before
he so much as changed his position.</p>

<p>Then he started to his feet, and the two in
hiding crouched yet closer to the ground, fearing
lest he had grown suspicious; but it was
merely to change his position, and after looking
up and down the trail, muttering threats against
the soldiers because they continued their stroll
when it was not to his liking, he reseated himself
without having so much as touched his
musket.</p>

<div class="figcenter p2"><a name="i-210" id="i-210"></a>
<img src="images/i-210.jpg" width="350" height="553" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Nathan and Evan crept within three feet of the Tory.&mdash;<a href="#Page_193">Page 193</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>It was possible the redcoats might even now
be retracing their steps, and whatever the lads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
counted on doing must be done without loss of
time.</p>

<p>Nathan pressed Evan's hand in token that he
was ready for the venture, and the latter nodded
his head.</p>

<p>The two rose to their feet, standing motionless
a single instant, and then, darting forward
with a sudden spring, they landed directly upon
the unsuspecting Tory.</p>

<p>Nathan had counted upon covering the spy's
mouth with his hand; but missed the aim, and
Ephraim was enabled to utter one shrill cry,
after which he was powerless to do more than
breathe.</p>

<p>"Work quickly now, for the soldiers may
have heard that, and we are like to be prisoners
ourselves instead of capturing this sneak,"
Nathan whispered. "We must tie his hands
again, and contrive something for a gag quickly."</p>

<p>As deftly, and yet more rapidly than on that
night when Sarah Dillard rode the unbroken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
colt, Evan bound the prisoner, and from the
time they first leaped upon him until Ephraim's
hands were tied and his mouth choked by a
portion of his own garments, no more than
three minutes had passed.</p>

<p>"Take his musket, for it must appear as if he
had gone back to the camp, and see to it that
you wipe out all traces of a struggle, while I
carry him into the thicket."</p>

<p>Then the boy lifted Ephraim to his shoulder
as if he had been no more than a package of
bulky merchandise, and while Evan carried out
the instructions to the best of his ability, the
spy was taken an hundred yards or more into
the thicket.</p>

<p>Here Nathan halted until his comrade joined
him, when the two continued the flight until
they were fully half a mile from the trail, and
all this while Ephraim Sowers was unable to
give vent to his anger or his fears.</p>

<p>"That was a neat job, and one that need not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
interfere with the purpose of our journey,"
Nathan said in a tone of exultation, as he wiped
the perspiration from his face and sat down
where he could look full at the discomfited
Tory. "By this means we have made certain
of coming face to face with Ephraim Sowers
again, for I misdoubt if he would have been
found in the battle unless peradventure the
Britishers were getting much the best of it."</p>

<p>"Now that we have got the sneak, what is to
be done with him?"</p>

<p>"Tie him up here until we have concluded
our work, and then carry him back to the men
of Colonel Clarke's command, who have a score
to settle because of his efforts to deliver them
over to their butchers."</p>

<p>The expression in Ephraim's eyes gave good
token of the terror which was in his heart, and
in furtherance of the plan he had lately conceived
Nathan took the gag from the boy's
mouth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>"Those men would murder me!" Ephraim
screamed as soon as his mouth was freed from
the gag.</p>

<p>"Ay, so it appears to me, else will they be
more forgiving than I can well believe," Nathan
replied calmly, as if in his mind the spy was
already doomed.</p>

<p>"Would you take me, who has never done
you any wrong, to where I shall be killed?" he
whined.</p>

<p>"How much wrong would you have done had
we not set upon you the night the force at
Greene's Spring were to be massacred?" Evan
asked sternly. "When we were again captured
was it in your mind to treat us as friends?"</p>

<p>"I would not have killed you."</p>

<p>"Then you lied in order to frighten us."</p>

<p>"I did want to make you weaken, but had
no thought of doing you a wrong."</p>

<p>"Such a controversy is useless, and we have
not the time to spend upon it," Nathan interrupted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
"Colonel Clarke's men are doubtless
eager to meet with this Tory who devoted so
much of his time to them, and if it so be we
are forced to continue on in order to gain information
concerning the Britishers, we can do no
other than deliver him up to them."</p>

<p>"What is it you want to know?" Ephraim
asked, a ray of hope coming into his eyes.</p>

<p>"We are sent to learn concerning the British
forces. How many there are, where they are
encamped, and such other matters as may be
necessary for the guidance of those who direct
the attack."</p>

<p>"Is there to be a battle?" Ephraim asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not before we have had time to deliver you
over to those who will thank us for so
doing."</p>

<p>The gleam of hope died away very suddenly,
and the spy, knowing full well what would
likely be his fate, did he fall into the hands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the men who would have been killed or captured
had his plans not failed, now gave evidence
of the liveliest terror.</p>

<p>"If you will save my life, I swear to tell you
all I know about Major Ferguson's forces, and
none can give the information better, for I have
been with them every hour since you were
allowed to leave Dillard's plantation."</p>

<p>"It might be that we could take advantage
of the offer, if it was possible to believe a single
word you uttered," Nathan said, as if debating
whether to accept the proposition or not.</p>

<p>"I swear to you that every word shall be
true, and if you hold me prisoner it will be easy
to know whether I have told the truth or not,"
Ephraim pleaded. "Promise that if I give all
the information needed you will save my life,
and you shall have such a description of the
camp as could not be gotten by scouting around
it for a week."</p>

<p>"Shall we accept the offer, Evan?" Nathan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
asked, as if it was a matter of indifference to
him, and Ephraim cried imploringly:</p>

<p>"Give me one chance! Don't turn me over
to those who have good reason for murdering
me! I will answer every question truly, and
you shall keep me prisoner until it has been
proven that all I said was correct."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="s08">KING'S MOUNTAIN.</span></h2>

<p>Having brought Ephraim Sowers into that
frame of mind where he could be utilized,
Nathan made the pretense of consulting with
Evan as to the advisability of accepting the
spy's information.</p>

<p>"If Evan will agree to it, we may promise
that you shall not be given up to Colonel
Clarke's men, although, as a matter of course,
we have no intention of setting you at liberty."</p>

<p>"All I ask is that you put me under the
charge of Colonel Charles McDowells, you promising
me in his name that I shall receive the
same treatment as any other prisoner."</p>

<p>"It is a great deal you are asking, Ephraim
Sowers, after all you have done and tried to do;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
but it may be that we can arrange it. Come
this way, Evan," and Nathan stepped aside a
few paces to give the Tory an idea that considerable
argument would be necessary in order to
induce his comrade to enter into the agreement.</p>

<p>"Can we believe what he says?" Evan asked
when he and Nathan stood at such a distance
from the prisoner that their words could not be
overheard.</p>

<p>"I do not understand how he would dare to
tell a lie. When our men advance it will be
known if he has given the correct information,
and we will make it plain that should he tell
us anything which was proven to be incorrect,
then our promises are withdrawn."</p>

<p>"Go on, and arrange the matter as soon as
you can, for no one can say when some of the
redcoats may come this way on a scout, and if
we should chance to fall into the hands of the
enemy now, I think that Tory sneak would kill
us, if the murder could be compassed."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>The two remained as if in conversation a
moment longer, and then returning to the terrified
spy, Nathan said in a solemn tone:</p>

<p>"We have agreed that if you give us all the
information in your power concerning Major
Ferguson's force, and you claim to know everything
regarding it, we will carry you as prisoner
to Evan's father, promising in his name
that you shall be treated the same as any Britisher
that might be captured. Should, however,
it be discovered that you played us false
in the slightest detail, it will be the same as if
our promise had not been given, and you will
be turned over to Colonel Clarke's men."</p>

<p>"I am not likely to tell that which is not true
when my life depends upon the truth," Ephraim
said in a tone which convinced his hearers that,
perhaps for the first time in his life, he was
resolved to make a correct statement.</p>

<p>"Well," Evan said impatiently after a brief
pause. "Why don't you begin?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>"What shall I tell you?"</p>

<p>"How many men has Major Ferguson?"</p>

<p>"I must not be held as to the truth of numbers,
for I only know what I heard a commissary
sergeant say, which was that there were eleven
hundred and twenty all told upon the mountain."</p>

<p>"What mountain?"</p>

<p>"The force is encamped on the summit of
King's Mountain, which is about twelve miles
north of the Cherokee Ford."</p>

<p>"How far from here?"</p>

<p>"I should say less than an hour's march."</p>

<p>"Have the troops any other weapons than
muskets?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How many are the king's soldiers, and how
many Tories?"</p>

<p>"There are not above two hundred of his
majesty's troops."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea why the major chanced
to take that place as an encampment?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>"Our scouts have brought in the word that
the rebels were gathering in large numbers, and
the major established his camp where it could
not well be attacked."</p>

<p>"How long has he been there?"</p>

<p>"Two days."</p>

<p>"Do you know if he intends making a move
soon?"</p>

<p>"I have heard it said in the camp that we
were like to stay there a long while&mdash;at least
until reinforcements can be sent by General
Cornwallis."</p>

<p>"Beside the men who came out with you on
the trail, how many are scouting around in this
neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"There are perhaps twenty who set out this
morning."</p>

<p>"Are they soldiers or Tories?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you would call them Tories, but
nevertheless they are royalists."</p>

<p>"There is a distinction without a difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
in those terms, Ephraim," Nathan said grimly,
"but I'll venture to say there are very few who
are both Tory and spy, with an inclination to
bring death upon those who had befriended
them."</p>

<p>"In taking to Major Ferguson information as
to Colonel Clarke's force I only did my duty,
for I was serving the king, and should look
upon all those who offer armed resistance to
his laws as enemies."</p>

<p>"You were not so strict in your allegiance
last winter, when you begged for food."</p>

<p>Ephraim winced but made no reply, and
Evan said thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"It appears to me we have gotten all the information
he has to give, and it stands us in
hand to return to camp as soon as may be, if
you think we are justified in pinning our faith
upon his statements."</p>

<p>"I swear that I have told you only the truth,"
Ephraim cried, beginning to fear lest his captors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
might recede from the position they had
taken.</p>

<p>"If there are twenty Britishers scouting
around the mountain I do not believe we can
learn any more than he has told us," Nathan
said half to himself, "and it appears to me as if
we had good reason for believing our mission
had been fulfilled."</p>

<p>"Then let us lose no time in retracing our
steps, for there yet remains twenty-six or twenty-seven
miles to be traversed nightfall."</p>

<p>"Where are your forces encamped?" Ephraim
asked.</p>

<p>"At the Cowpens, on Broad River. I heard
Captain Depuyster say, when it was told him
that some of the rebels&mdash;I mean your friends&mdash;were
gathered there, that it was twenty-eight
miles away."</p>

<p>"Then you know the exact distance it is
necessary for you to walk before sunset,"
Nathan replied. "We shall not be so cruel as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
to confine your arms, but you must march not
more than three paces in advance of us, and remember,
Ephraim Sowers, if you make any
movement which has the appearance as if you
were trying to give us the slip, we shall fire
with intent to kill, and at such short range
there can be little doubt as to the accuracy of
our aim. Are you ready, Evan?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the sooner we set out the better I
shall be pleased."</p>

<p>But for the fact that the young Tory was dependent
upon these two for his life, he would
have remonstrated against being forced to make
so long and hurried a journey; but under the
circumstances he did not dare say a single
word which might sound like a complaint.</p>

<p>He waited meekly until Nathan pointed out
the direction to be pursued, and then set off as
if eager to arrive at the destination, his captors
meanwhile keeping their eyes upon him and
being on the alert for any attempt at escape.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>There is little to tell regarding this long
tramp, a portion of which was made through
the thicket, and the remainder over the trail,
save to say that both the prisoner and his captors
were nearly exhausted before it came to an
ending.</p>

<p>Twice only did they halt, and then not more
than ten minutes at a time, lest by remaining
quiet too long their wearied limbs should
become stiffened.</p>

<p>Evan and Nathan had brought with them a
scanty supply of food, and this they shared with
Ephraim; but it was so small in quantity that
it served hardly more than to whet their appetites,
and when, shortly after sunset, they were
arrived at the American encampment, it seemed
to all three as if they were literally on the verge
of exhaustion.</p>

<p>The coming of the boys was hailed with
shouts of joy by the men, and when it was
learned who they brought with them as prisoner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
it appeared much as if the promise
Ephraim's captors had made would avail him
nothing.</p>

<p>Before they could make their way to Colonel
McDowells' quarters the three were surrounded
by a throng of hungry men, who insisted that
the Tory should be hanged offhand for his
crime; and but little attention was paid to the
entreaties of Nathan and Evan, who announced
again and again that they had pledged their
word for his safety.</p>

<p>"We have sworn that he shall be put into
the custody of Colonel Charles McDowells, and
trusting in our word he has given us valuable
information concerning the enemy," Nathan
cried at the full strength of his lungs, when the
throng became so great that they were forced
to come to a halt.</p>

<p>"Hang the spy! He is one who brought
Ferguson's troopers down to Greene's Spring that
Clarke's men might be massacred. Hang him!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>Ephraim kneeled upon the ground, clinging
to the legs of the boys, alternately praying that
they would guard him and reminding them of
the promises made.</p>

<p>"Although he merits death we will keep
faith with him, and he who lays a hand on the
Tory must first dispose of us!" Evan cried.</p>

<p>The men were in no mood to listen to reason,
and it is more than likely the boys would have
failed in their purpose but that Colonel William
Campbell, hearing the tumult, came quickly up
to learn the cause.</p>

<p>Hurriedly and in the fewest possible words
Nathan explained the situation of affairs, and
Ephraim's life was saved for the time being,
for the colonel, calling for the Virginia force,
formed a guard around the prisoner and his
captors, holding the mob in check until all were
arrived at Colonel McDowells' quarters.</p>

<p>Here Ephraim was delivered to Evan's father
and Colonel James Williams, and these two officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
decided that the young scouts had acted
wisely in returning, for they placed every dependence
in the statements made by Ephraim,
who, as Colonel Williams said, "had for the
first time the truth frightened out of him."</p>

<p>The lads were directed to go in search of
food, and when, an hour later, they returned to
Colonel McDowells' quarters, Ephraim was nowhere
to be seen.</p>

<p>"What have you done with the Tory?" Evan
asked, fearing for the instant lest his father had
forgotten that their word was pledged for his
safe keeping.</p>

<p>"It was best he should not remain in camp,
for the men were grown so excited that I doubt
if I could have held them in check. Your spy
has been sent away where we can make certain
he will be held in safe custody."</p>

<p>Then the colonel asked for the details of the
journey just ended, and when this had been
given, he startled them by saying:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>"Since receiving the information from Ephraim
Sowers, it has been decided that we will
set out at once in pursuit of the enemy, lest
Major Ferguson change his plans, and lead us a
long chase. We have nine hundred men well
mounted, and these will start within an hour,
continuing the march until they shall come up
with the enemy; meanwhile the footmen, and
those whose animals are not in the best of condition,
will follow as fast as possible."</p>

<p>"Do you intend to attack the Britishers, intrenched
as they are on the mountain?" Evan
asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Ay, lad, we will set upon them wherever
they may be found, and whip them too, till
there shall be no more left of this force which
has come to lay waste the country with fire and
sword."</p>

<p>"But what of Nathan and I?" Evan asked
anxiously. "Are we to be left behind?"</p>

<p>"It is time you had some rest, lads, and better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
you should follow with those who march
afoot."</p>

<p>"In that case, sir, we might miss the battle,"
Nathan interrupted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it were better if you did."</p>

<p>"We have thought, sir, Evan and I, that because
of working hard for the cause, we would
be given the first opportunity to show what we
might do."</p>

<p>"And you are eager to go into the combat?"
Colonel McDowells asked of his son.</p>

<p>"It would sadden me if I was not allowed to
do so, sir, although, as I have confessed to
Nathan several times, I fear my courage may
fail me."</p>

<p>"If it does, you will be the first McDowells
who has shown the white feather, and perhaps
it is time we should know whether you are of
the right strain. You shall ride with the advance
forces," Colonel McDowells said decidedly,
and then turned away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="s08">A HOT CHASE.</span></h2>

<p>The two lads were well content with the
assurance given by Colonel McDowells, even
though each would have been forced to admit,
in event of close questioning, that, while eager
to bear a full share of all the dangers, the prospect
of taking part in a pitched battle brought
with it a certain degree of nervous apprehension.</p>

<p>It was known because of what Ephraim
Sowers had told, and could have been well
understood even though the Tory lad had not
chosen to purchase safety by revealing the
secrets of those whom he claimed as friends,
that Major Ferguson's force was intrenched
after such fashion as was possible, and, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
addition, the position was rendered yet stronger
by being on the mountain, up which the
"rebels" must climb in order to make an
attack.</p>

<p>Another advantage which the Britishers had,
was in point of weapons and ammunition.
They were thoroughly well equipped with the
best quality of arms, with powder and ball in
abundance, while the friends of liberty had but
a scanty supply of either.</p>

<p>Despite such facts, however, not a man among
those who had sworn to relieve the colonies
from the yoke of the oppressor counted the
odds. The only thought was that at last the
Britishers were where a battle could not be
avoided, and the mountain men were determined
that the conflict should result in a victory
for the "rebels."</p>

<p>The troop did not begin the march as soon
as Colonel McDowells had proposed, however.</p>

<p>Although the colonists were few in numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
and with scanty outfit, there was much to be
done by way of preparation for the unequal
struggle, and when an hour had elapsed they
were yet in camp, but nearly ready to set out.</p>

<p>During such time Nathan and Evan had
nothing to do save watch the movements of
those around them, without being able to take
any part in the work, and although both were
in need of repose, it was impossible to rest at a
time when they were laboring under the mental
excitement caused by the knowledge of what
was before them.</p>

<p>Now and then one or another of the men
would question the lads regarding their reconnoissance
of Major Ferguson's camp, when
Ephraim Sowers was captured, and in the
course of such conversations the two boys soon
learned where their prisoner had been taken.</p>

<p>One of the squad which had been charged
with conveying the young Tory beyond reach
of those who would have hanged him without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
loss of time, returned to camp in order to
accompany his comrades on the march which it
was believed would be ended by a battle, and
displayed no little curiosity as to how Ephraim
had been captured.</p>

<p>"To hear the young villain talk, one would
think a dozen men couldn't overpower him.
He declared that his reluctance to shed the
blood of former playmates saved you lads from
death."</p>

<p>"It would seem that he has recovered somewhat
from his fears," Nathan replied with a
hearty laugh. "When I last saw him he was
playing the part of coward to perfection."</p>

<p>"He insists that you took advantage of his
former friendship, and while calling for assistance,
basely fell upon him when he was giving
the aid you begged for."</p>

<p>To Nathan there was something extremely
comical in such a story as told by Ephraim
Sowers, who never displayed the slightest semblance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
of courage save when there was no
possible chance he could come to any harm.</p>

<p>Evan's anger was aroused, however, and without
delay he not only explained how they had
captured the Tory, but gave additional details
concerning the incident at Captain Dillard's
house, when Ephraim suddenly found the tables
turned upon him.</p>

<p>"He could not have attempted to do a more
deadly wrong than when he gave information
which he fully believed would result in the
death or capture of Colonel Clark's force at
Greene's Springs," Evan said in conclusion,
"and while Nathan and I have given our word
that he shall be held safe from personal harm,
I hope careful watch will be kept upon him.
Insignificant though the lad is, he may be able
to do us very much injury."</p>

<p>"Joseph Abbott has been detailed to
guard him," the trooper said thoughtfully,
"and perhaps a more steady man should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
been assigned to the work. Abbott means
well; but is inclined to be careless, although it's
certain he understands how necessary it is the
Tory be held safely this night."</p>

<p>"Yes, and for many a long day to come,"
Nathan added gravely. "Until the Britishers
have been driven from the Carolinas, Ephraim
must be held close prisoner, because it is in his
power to give them all needful information as to
our probable movements. There can be no
question but that his father aids in the work,
and while it is not generally understood that
such is the case, much harm can be done."</p>

<p>The trooper felt confident that Abbott could
be relied upon for twenty-four hours at least,
because he would remain at his own home, and
surely there he should be able to make certain
the prisoner did not escape.</p>

<p>Then the conversation turned upon the probable
battle, and this was of such vital interest
to the boys that, for the moment, they almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
forgot such a lad as Ephraim Sowers ever had
an existence.</p>

<p>It was fated, however, that they were to drop
him from their thoughts for some time to come,
and soon there was more reason than ever
before to fear his power of working mischief.</p>

<p>Word had been passed for the horses to be
saddled preparatory to beginning the march toward
King's Mountain, and Nathan and Evan
were attending to the steeds which had been
provided for them, when a sudden commotion
on the outskirts of the encampment caused
every member of the troop to look about him
in alarm.</p>

<p>The sound of voices in loud, angry conversation
could be heard; but it was not possible for
the lads to distinguish any words save these:</p>

<p>"He should have been hanged! It was
little less than a crime to allow him to live!"</p>

<p>"Of whom are they speaking?" Evan asked
in surprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>"It can be none other than Ephraim, and yet
I had supposed he would be forgotten, until
after the battle."</p>

<p>"The men must have learned more of his
doings, for certain it is that no one has given him
a thought during the last half-hour."</p>

<p>A moment later it became evident that whatever
had caused this last outburst against the
Tory spy was of considerable importance, for
the cries of anger were redoubled as a full third
of the little army ceased their work of preparation
to gather around the officers' quarters.</p>

<p>"Something has gone wrong!" Nathan exclaimed
as the confusion increased. "When
the command has been given for us to saddle,
the men would not spend valuable time crying
out against such as Ephraim Sowers. Can it
be possible he has escaped?"</p>

<p>"That is an idle proposition, for Joseph
Abbott could not have been so careless," Evan
replied; but there was a sudden tremor of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
voice which told that he was not as confident
as the words implied.</p>

<p>The boys no longer gave any heed to their
steed; but pressed on toward the throng which
was surging around the officers' quarters, until
it was possible to hear yet more of that which
the excited men said.</p>

<p>"Abbott was the last man in the Carolinas
who should have been trusted with such a
duty!"</p>

<p>"If we had hanged the villain it would not
now be possible for him to do us so much mischief!"</p>

<p>"Now that the Britishers are certain to be
warned of our movements, there is little hope
of taking them by surprise!"</p>

<p>These and similar remarks gave the eager,
perturbed boys a fair idea of what had occurred;
but yet Nathan would not credit that
which appeared to be a fact until having more
definite assurance that the young Tory was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
a condition to work wrong to the patriots of the
Carolinas.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he asked of a man
who was insisting that the officers were guilty
of a great crime when they prevented the men
from hanging the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Happened?" the man repeated angrily.
"That young Tory whose neck should have
been stretched an hour ago, has given Joseph
Abbott the slip, an' is most likely on his way to
King's Mountain in order to inform Major
Ferguson of what we would have done this
night!"</p>

<p>"Ephraim escaped?" Evan repeated in dismay,
and immediately there came to him the
knowledge of all it might be possible for the
Tories to effect.</p>

<p>It was certain that once Major Ferguson had
been warned of the proposed attack, it would
be so guarded against that a heavy loss of life
on the part of the Americans must inevitably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
be the result, and prudence would dictate that
the movement be abandoned.</p>

<p>Insignificant though Ephraim Sowers was,
he now had it in his power to save the king's
troops from severe loss, and could, most likely,
thwart the patriots at the very moment when
they might strike such a blow as would free
the Carolinas from the invaders.</p>

<p>The escape of the Tory was the most disastrous
happening that could have been brought
about by the enemies of the colonies, and the
knowledge that it was possible only by sheer
carelessness on the part of a true friend to the
Cause, served to aggravate the offense which
had been committed.</p>

<p>Here and there a man swore to hang Joseph
Abbott if he dared to show himself in this
section of the country again, and the more hot-headed
demanded that Colonel Campbell and
Colonel McDowells should suffer in some way
because of having interposed to save the prisoner's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
life when there were troopers standing by
ready to execute him.</p>

<p>During ten minutes or more the tumult was
great; all discipline had been lost sight of, and
there seemed every danger much mischief would
be done by those justly angry men who believed
themselves thus prevented from breaking
the rule of the king in the Carolinas at the very
moment when it might have been successfully
accomplished.</p>

<p>During this time Nathan and Evan had been
forcing their way toward that point where
Colonel McDowells and Colonel Campbell were
facing the angry soldiers, believing for the
moment that an attack was about to be made
upon them, and then it was Evan's father spoke
for the first time since the lads had come within
earshot.</p>

<p>"I am ashamed that men of the Carolinas
will thus cry out for the death of a boy, how
ever much injury he may have done, or can yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
do us. We war against the representatives of
the king, not with children."</p>

<p>"It was he who would have compassed our
death!" one of Colonel Clark's men shouted
vindictively.</p>

<p>"Very true, and it is right that he be
deprived of his liberty; but more than that
would have been a stain upon your honor such
as could never be rubbed out."</p>

<p>"If he had been held prisoner we should have
remained silent," another soldier cried. "Now
he is turned lose to carry Major Ferguson such
information as will put to naught all our
efforts."</p>

<p>"Is Abbott here to say how the lad escaped?"
Colonel Campbell asked.</p>

<p>"His wife came with the news that her husband
has gone on the trail of the viper."</p>

<p>"Then who shall say that such mischief has
been done?" Colonel McDowells cried, his voice
taking on a more hopeful ring. "To hear such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
bewailing as you men are indulging in, one
would say there is no remedy left us. It is
probably true the Tory has escaped; but he
cannot have very much of a start, since no more
than three hours are passed since he was led
from this camp. There are twenty-eight miles
between us and King's Mountain. We are
ready to set out at once. Will you admit that
such horses as are owned by you may not
cover that distance before a boy can do so on
foot? Shame upon you for thus showing the
white feather when there is a possibility of repairing
the mischief!"</p>

<p>Some of the throng stepped back a few paces
as if regretting that they had been so loud spoken;
but the greater number remained in front of
the two officers in a defiant and angry attitude.</p>

<p>"Where is Evan McDowells?" the colonel
cried, raising his voice that the question might
be heard throughout the encampment, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
had no sooner spoken than Evan and Nathan
forced their way through the crowd until standing
directly before the officer, who added to the
insubordinate men, "My son and Nathan
Shelby&mdash;the same lads who captured the Tory&mdash;shall
go out in search of him. Half a
dozen more will be sent in as many different
directions, and instead of standing here indulging
in vain words, we may repair the mischief.
This, however, I demand, and will consider him
my personal enemy who disobeys what is a
positive command: When the spy is retaken,
see to it, each and every one, that his life be
held sacred! These boys gave him an assurance,
in return for certain information, that he
should not come to harm, and I will never allow
such pledge to be broken."</p>

<p>"We shall only be safe when he is dead!" a
trooper cried in a surly tone.</p>

<p>"And you are willing, Angus McLeod, to
admit that you are afraid of a boy!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, Colonel McDowells, of such a boy as is
that young Tory. While he lives we know
full well all our doings will be carried to the
king's officers."</p>

<p>"How may that be now that we have come
to know him for what he is? A month ago it
was different, because you allowed him in and
around your encampment; but to-day, with full
knowledge of his character, how can he do you
harm? When he is taken, as I feel certain he
must be within a short time, turn him over to
me; I will be personally responsible that he no
longer has the power to work us an injury."</p>

<p>Then turning from the discontented men as
if he had done with them, the colonel said to
Evan and Nathan:</p>

<p>"Lads, now has come the time when you may
perform such a service for the Carolinas as, perhaps,
is not within the power of any other. I
do not hold that you are more skillful or keen
on the trail than your companions; but there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
in my mind the belief that you will succeed
where older searchers may fail. Set out immediately;
spare not your horses, nor yourselves,
until Ephraim Sowers is once more your
prisoner."</p>

<p>"But in event of our being so fortunate as to
come upon him, sir, we shall be deprived of
taking part in the battle," Evan said mournfully,
and his father replied quickly, but in a
whisper:</p>

<p>"There will be no battle if he escapes to
carry information to Major Ferguson."</p>

<p>"There will be in case we shall make him
prisoner within a few hours."</p>

<p>"In that event you may leave him with
Abbott, whom, I dare venture to say, will not
give way to carelessness again, or in the custody
of any whom you know to be true. We
shall ride the direct trail to King's Mountain,
and you should be able to overtake us if the
work be performed quickly."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>There was no thought in the mind of either
lad that such an order as the colonel had given
could be slighted, and while it would have
grieved them to the heart had an engagement
come off while they were absent from the troop,
neither hesitated.</p>

<p>As they turned to leave, Colonel Campbell
gave orders to several of the men that they
ride at once in pursuit of the late prisoner, and
Nathan whispered to his comrade while they
walked as quickly as the throng would permit
toward where their horses had been left:</p>

<p>"I am not positive, Evan, how we might
carry ourselves in the midst of a battle. While
neither of us would admit to being cowardly, it
is possible we showed a certain amount of fear
when brought face to face with the king's
troops. Now we have one more opportunity
of proving ourselves equal to the part of men,
without chance of displaying the white
feather."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>"I fail to understand the meaning of so many
words," Evan replied petulantly. "To me the
only thing certain is, that we may not follow
where much honor is to be won."</p>

<p>"If it should so chance that we come upon
Ephraim Sowers, when others failed of finding
him, we will gain more credit than if we rode
in the front ranks of those whom I hope will
charge Major Ferguson's force before to-morrow
night. Let us give over repining at what cannot
be changed, and set ourselves about the task
of running that miserable Tory down!"</p>

<p>Evan was not disposed to look at the matter
in such a light, although never for a moment
did he dream of disobeying his father's commands.
To him this setting off on a blind
search for the young spy was simply shutting
themselves out from all chance of riding with
the men of the Carolinas when they charged
the enemy, and it seemed for the moment as if
no greater misfortune could befall them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>However, he made no protest against whatever
his comrade suggested, although confident
that with a start in his favor of even one hour,
it would be impossible for them to overtake
Ephraim Sowers, more particularly since half a
dozen men were to join in the hunt, and without
loss of time the two lads made ready for the
search.</p>

<p>There was no thought of making provisions
for any lengthy absence; the work, to be of any
avail, must be done before midnight, and if at
that time the Tory was yet at liberty, then
might the searchers return to their comrades,
for it would be good proof Ephraim had succeeded
in eluding them so far as to be able to
give Major Ferguson information of what was
afoot.</p>

<p>Therefore the only care was to make certain
their supply of ammunition would be sufficient
for a spirited attack or resistance, after which
they rode through the encampment, and half a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
mile beyond were halted by Mrs. Abbott, who
was returning slowly to her home.</p>

<p>"Are you young gentlemen setting out in
search of the Tory?" she asked when the two
lads halted in response to her signal.</p>

<p>"We are, and many others will ride on the
same errand."</p>

<p>"The soldiers were so angry with Joseph that
I had no opportunity to repeat all the message
he sent. It was not through the fault of my
husband that the prisoner escaped; he was left
bound by the hands as when brought to our
house, while we made ready a room in which
he could be safely kept, and by some means
managed to free himself."</p>

<p>"We have no time for such unimportant particulars,"
Nathan interrupted. "The main fact
is that he is free, and we are among those
charged with the search for him."</p>

<p>"Joseph set out on the same errand within
five minutes after his escape was discovered, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
he bade me say to whosoever might come, that
the trail led over the hills to the westward.
You will have no difficulty in following it, and
should come up with my husband before riding
very far."</p>

<p>"We thank you for the information, and
would ride ahead if you are able to direct us to
your home," Nathan replied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Abbott, who appeared to be in deepest
distress because the prisoner intrusted to her husband's
keeping had made his escape, gave the boys
ample directions for finding the house and as
the two rode rapidly forward Nathan said in a
hopeful tone:</p>

<p>"There is yet a chance, Evan, that we shall
succeed where the others failed, thanks to our
having met Abbott's wife. If the trail is well-defined,
we shall be able to ride it down, capture
the spy, and return to the encampment before
our people have set out.</p>

<p>"That is what we should do, but whether we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
can or not is quite another matter," Evan replied
gloomily. "It is a pity we promised the Tory
our protection, otherwise he would have been
beyond all power for harm long ere this."</p>

<p>"And would you like to remember that we
captured a lad who was once our friend, for
others to hang in cold blood?"</p>

<p>"Almost anything would be better than that
we were shut out from following those with
whom we should ride this night."</p>

<p>"I am counting that we will yet bear them
company," Nathan replied cheerily. "Even a
Tory cannot make his way across the country
without leaving a trail, and now that we know
where it may be taken up, the rest ought to be
easy."</p>

<p>"Unless he has suddenly lost his senses, we
cannot follow him on horseback. If I was trying
to escape from mounted men, it would not
be difficult to strike such a course as should be
impossible for them to follow."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>"That he did not do so at the start is positive,
else Abbott would never have sent such
word by his wife," Nathan replied, heeding not
the petulance of his comrade. "If we hold to
it that Ephraim Sowers has made his escape,
then is he the same as free, but I shall continue
to claim we have fair chance of overtaking him,
until we know beyond a peradventure that he
cannot be found. Every second is of value to
us now, and we'll waste no more time in idle
talk."</p>

<p>With this remark, which Evan might well
have construed as a rebuke, Nathan struck his
horse sharply with the spurs, and the two
quickly left Mrs. Abbott far in the rear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="s08">SUCCESS.</span></h2>

<p>In silence the two lads rode on at the full
speed of their horses until they were come to
the home of the man who had caused so much
trouble through his carelessness, and here
Nathan dismounted, leading his steed by the
bridle as he made a complete circuit of the
building.</p>

<p>To boys who had been taught the art of
woodcraft because it was absolutely necessary
they should be expert in following a trail or
hiding one, it was a simple matter to ascertain
where the Tory had made his escape from the
house, and at what point he struck into the
woods, although a person ignorant of such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
matters might have looked in vain for any token
of the flight.</p>

<p>"There's no need of spending much time over
such a plain sign as that," Evan said, now
recovered somewhat from his petulance, for hope
that they might soon recapture the spy had
sprung up in his heart. "I never would have
believed Ephraim Sowers was such a simple as
to thus give information regarding his movements!
Surely he knew Abbott would set out
at once in pursuit, and yet has made no attempt
to hide his trail."</p>

<p>"He is a coward who allows his fears to blind
him from anything except immediate danger.
Having seen an unexpected opportunity to escape,
he takes advantage of it, and thinks only of
putting a great distance between himself and
his enemies. We shall soon ride him down!"</p>

<p>"Unless he gathers his wits, and takes to the
thicket where we cannot follow."</p>

<p>"Then it will be necessary to make our way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
on foot, and I'll warrant that we travel as fast
as he can. But I'm not allowing he'll gather
his wits until having come to a British camp."</p>

<p>During this brief conversation Nathan remounted,
and the two rode along the trail, having
no difficulty in keeping well in view the
signs left by both the pursued and the pursuer.</p>

<p>Abbot had taken good care not to cover the
footsteps of the Tory, and to leave ample token
of the course he was following; therefore it was
certain the lads must soon come upon one or the
other, since they were well mounted.</p>

<p>There was one danger Evan had failed to
realize, but which was strong in Nathan's mind.
If Ephraim could retain his liberty until night
came, then would it be well-nigh impossible to
follow him during the hours of darkness; and
this very important fact may have been in the
spy's mind when he pushed on regardless of
thus giving good proof as to his whereabouts to
those who might come in pursuit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore it was Nathan rode on at the best
speed of his horse, and his comrade found it
difficult to maintain the pace, consequently there
was no opportunity for conversation during
twenty minutes or more, at the end of which
time they were come up with Abbott.</p>

<p>That the trooper was suffering keenest mental
distress because of his carelessness, which had
permitted of the spy's escape, could readily be
seen even during the hurried interview they held
with the man.</p>

<p>"You are come in good time, for the Tory
can't be more than a mile ahead of us," he said
with a sigh of relief. "The sun will not set for
two hours, and long before then you should
have him in your keeping once more."</p>

<p>"You will follow as close as may be, for we
count on turning him over to you again in order
that we may ride to King's Mountain with the
American force," Nathan replied, not averse to
giving his horse a brief breathing spell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>"You may be certain he won't get out of my
sight again! Any other might have had the
same misfortune as I. His hands were bound,
and I left him in an upper room while I made
ready the chamber that was to serve as prison."</p>

<p>"Why did you not keep him with you?"
Evan asked sharply.</p>

<p>"That is what should have been done, as I
now know full well; but at the time it seemed
as if the lad was as secure as if surrounded by
a troop of soldiers. Certain it is he can't free
his hands, and, therefore, must necessarily travel
slowly. I suppose every man at the camp bears
down heavily upon me?"</p>

<p>Nathan would have evaded this question; but
Evan was minded that the careless soldier should
be made to realize how great was his offence,
therefore he answered bluntly:</p>

<p>"I believe of a verity you would have been
hanged had it been possible for the men to get
hold of you when the news of the escape was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
first brought in. If Ephraim Sowers succeeds
in remaining at liberty, the attack upon King's
Mountain will be abandoned, and that at a time
when it might have been a success but for your
carelessness."</p>

<p>"See here, Abbott," Nathan added soothingly,
"it is not for me to deny the truth of
what Evan says; but he is describing that first
moment of disappointment. Your comrades
have grown more calm by this time, and if it
so be we overhaul the Tory, it is Colonel
McDowell's orders that he be given into your
custody again."</p>

<p>"I'll shoot the villain rather than let him get
a dozen yards from me, if he falls into my
clutches once more, an' I've sworn not to go
home inside of forty-eight hours without him."</p>

<p>It was in Evan's mind to say that it would
have been better had Abbott kept a close
watch of his prisoner, in which case such
desperate measures would not now be necessary;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
but he realized in time to check his speech,
that harsh words were of no avail now the
mischief was done, and contented himself with
the caution:</p>

<p>"It will be well to remember how much
trouble has been caused, if we are so fortunate
as to catch the Tory. My fear is that he may
succeed in giving us the slip after all, in which
case the attack on Major Ferguson's force is
frustrated even before being made."</p>

<p>The horses had been allowed as long a resting
spell as Nathan thought necessary, and he
brought the interview to an end by saying as he
tightened rein:</p>

<p>"We shall ride the trail at our best pace,
and do you follow on until finding that we are
forced to leave the steeds, when it will be known
that there is no longer a hope of taking him in
time to set the fears of our people at rest before
the hour for making an advance. In event of
our coming upon him, we shall be glad to turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
him over to your keeping once more, as soon as
may be possible."</p>

<p>"I'll keep mighty near your horses' heels,
unless you ride at a better gait than I believe
will be possible. Don't hesitate to shoot him
down if you get within range and find there's a
chance of his getting the best of the chase."</p>

<p>"There's no need to give us such advice,"
Evan replied grimly. "Do your part at holding
him, if it so be you have another chance."</p>

<p>Nathan had urged his steed forward, and the
two spurred on at a sharp trot, each rider's eyes
fastened upon the ground where could be
plainly seen, by those accustomed to such work,
the footprints of the Tory.</p>

<p>Evan was rapidly recovering from the fit of
petulance which had seized upon when it appeared
most likely they would be shut out
from riding into battle with the American
force.</p>

<p>Now it began to seem possible they might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
perform the task set them and return to the
encampment before the advance was begun,
unless it so chanced that Ephraim Sowers suddenly
showed sufficient wit to seek refuge in a
thicket where the horses could not follow.</p>

<p>Something of this kind Evan said to his comrade
as they rode on the trail nearly side by
side, and the latter replied cheerily:</p>

<p>"The miserable Tory don't dare do anything
of the kind lest he lose his way. I venture to
say his only thought is that Abbott will set out
in pursuit of him, rather than spend time by
going to the encampment, therefore he has only
to fear what one man afoot may be able to do.
It hasn't come into his thick head that the
woman could be sent with a message, while her
husband took to the trail, therefore he will hold
to the open path until hearing the hoof-beats of
our horses."</p>

<p>And this was indeed what Ephraim Sowers
did, as his pursuers soon learned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>Nathan and Evan rode swiftly and in silence
during twenty minutes or more after leaving
Abbott, understanding full well that the trail
was growing fresher each instant; and then the
former saw a certain suspicious movement of
branches at one side of the path some distance
away.</p>

<p>"He has seen us!" the lad cried excitedly,
spurring his horse forward until he came to that
point where the trail suddenly branched off
toward the thicket.</p>

<p>There could be no question but that the Tory
had failed of hearing the noise of the pursuit
until his enemies were close upon him, and
then he did what he should have done an hour
before.</p>

<p>There was not a second to be lost, for once
the lad was so far in advance that his movements
could not be followed by the motion of
the foliage, it would be like the proverbial
hunt for a needle in a haystack to find him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"Look after the horses!" Nathan cried,
reining in his steed and leaping to the ground
musket in hand, and even before Evan could
come up, although but a few paces in the rear,
Isaac Shelby's nephew had disappeared in the
thicket.</p>

<p>Young McDowells was not disposed to obey
this command strictly. He cared for the steeds
by hurriedly tying their bridles to the trunk of
a tree, and after a delay of no more than half a
minute, followed his comrade into the forest,
with musket in hand ready to be discharged at
the first glimpse of the fugitive.</p>

<p>So close behind Nathan was Evan, that he
could readily follow his movements by the commotion
among the underbrush, and, with a sudden
burst of speed, regardless of possible accident,
he succeeded in coming close to his comrade's
heels.</p>

<p>"Have you lost sight of him?" he asked
breathlessly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" was the cheery reply.
"There is little fear he can give us the slip now
we are so near!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you fire on the chance of winging
him? I can give you my loaded musket
when yours is empty."</p>

<p>"There's no need of wasting a cartridge
upon him; we shall soon bring the villain in
sight."</p>

<p>It was not possible to carry on any extended
conversation while running at full speed among
the foliage, at great risk of falling headlong over
a projecting root, or being stricken down by a
low-hanging limb.</p>

<p>They were gaining in the chase as could
readily be seen, and when perhaps ten minutes
had passed the lads were so near that it seemed
certain Ephraim could be no more than a dozen
yards in advance.</p>

<p>"No one can say what accident may happen
at any moment to give him an advantage!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Evan said sharply, speaking with difficulty because
of his heavy breathing. "You must
bring him down soon, or we may get back to
the encampment too late!"</p>

<p>No suggestion could have been made which
would have had greater weight than this; and,
raising his voice, at the same time priming the
musket as he ran, Nathan cried:</p>

<p>"Come to a halt, Ephraim Sowers, or I shall
fire! At this short range there is little danger
but that my bullet will strike its target, with
such good token of your whereabouts as you
are giving us."</p>

<p>The Tory made no reply; and the waving of
the bushes could still be seen, thus showing
that he had not obeyed the command.</p>

<p>"Do not delay, but shoot at once, and then
exchange muskets with me!" Evan cried in an
agony of apprehension, lest some unforeseen
chance give the fugitive such an advantage as
they could not overcome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>

<p>Nathan hesitated no longer. Raising the
weapon he fired in a line with the moving foliage,
and the report of the musket was followed
by a scream as of pain.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I didn't wait a few minutes
longer!" the lad cried, in a tone of deepest
regret. "Of course we were bound to stop
him; but it might have been done without
killing!"</p>

<p>Evan shared his comrade's regrets, believing
Ephraim had been seriously if not dangerously
wounded, and the two ran forward with
all speed, fully expecting to find their enemy
disabled or dead.</p>

<p>Therefore was their surprise all the greater
when the swaying of the branches told that the
Tory was yet able to keep his feet, and once
more Nathan shouted, this time in a tone of
anger:</p>

<p>"Halt, or I shall fire again! Give me your
musket, Evan, and do you load this one! Work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
quickly, for I'm not minded to linger over the
task of stopping him!"</p>

<p>The exchange of weapons was made without
delay, and once more Nathan fired. Again
came a scream as of pain from the fugitive;
but this time the pursuers were not troubled
in mind lest they had needlessly inflicted pain.</p>

<p>Nathan leaped forward as he discharged the
musket, and an instant later stood face to face
with Ephraim Sowers, who, with a rotten
branch upraised as a club, stood at bay where a
perfect network of trees, that had most likely
been overturned by the wind, barred his further
passage.</p>

<p>"I'll beat your brains out!" Ephraim
screamed viciously, brandishing his poor apology
for a weapon. "Don't make the mistake of
thinkin' I'll be carried back among them
rebels!"</p>

<p>"You had better give in peaceably, for we
shan't spend much time in arguing the matter,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Nathan said decidedly; but yet he did not
advance for the very good reason that he was
virtually unarmed, having dropped his musket
at the moment of emptying it, in order that he
might not be impeded in his movements.</p>

<p>Because he remained motionless, Ephraim believed
the lad was afraid, and pressed his supposed
advantage by crying, in a tone that was
very like the snarl of a cat:</p>

<p>"Keep your distance or I'll kill you! This
club will stand me as good a turn as the empty
muskets do you, an' I count on using it!"</p>

<p>By this time Evan came into view carrying
both weapons, and, seeing that the game was
brought to bay without opportunity of continuing
the flight, said quietly:</p>

<p>"Keep your eye on him, Nathan, and I'll
soon put in a charge that will bring him to
terms."</p>

<p>He had begun to load the musket as he
spoke, doing so with deliberation as if there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
was no good reason why he should make haste;
and such leisurely movements had even more
effect upon the Tory than did the show of
ammunition.</p>

<p>"I didn't count you had more than a single
charge," he said, with a whine.</p>

<p>"It seemed odd to me that you should suddenly
have plucked up so much courage,"
Nathan replied scornfully. "Even though our
ammunition had been exhausted, you could not
have held us back with that rotten club. Load
carefully, Evan, for I don't want to make any
mistake as to aim!"</p>

<p>"Are you countin' on killin' me?" Ephraim
cried, in an agony of terror, flinging down his
poor weapon and holding out both hands in
supplication. "Would you murder a fellow
who never did you any harm?"</p>

<p>"You are the veriest coward in the Carolinas;"
and Nathan spoke in a tone of such contempt
that even the thick-skinned Tory winced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"Come out here, and we'll make certain of
taking you back to Broad River!"</p>

<p>The Tory meekly obeyed, making no show
of protest lest he might bring down the anger
of his captors upon himself; and Evan said, as
he finished loading both weapons:</p>

<p>"Do you walk ahead, Nathan, and let him
follow. I'll come close at his heels, and we'll
spend no more time over this job than may be
necessary. Abbott should be near at hand by
the time we get back to the trail."</p>

<p>Ephraim obeyed in silence and, because he
neither begged nor whined, the boys feared lest
he had some plan of escape in his mind.</p>

<p>"Do not take your eyes from him for a single
instant," Nathan cried warningly as he led the
way in the manner suggested by Evan, "and
shoot at the first suspicious move he makes. We
have done this work in short order, and now it
will be because of our own carelessness if the
troop sets off without us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't think that I'm going to be so foolish
as to make another try at gettin' away," Ephraim
said sulkily. "There's no show for me in this
section of the country while the king's troops
are so far away, an' I ain't countin' on takin' the
chances of bein' shot."</p>

<p>"We shan't be so foolish as to take your
word for it," Evan replied. "I'll admit that
you won't make much of a fist toward escaping;
but time is precious with us just now, and we
can't afford to waste any in chasing you."</p>

<p>From that moment until they were come to
the trail where the horses had been left, no
word was spoken; and then the lads were
greeted by a cry of joy and triumph from
Abbott, who had just come into view.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd overhaul him!" the trooper
said exultantly; "and if he gives me the slip
again there'll be good reason for my bein'
hanged!"</p>

<p>"Do you think it will be safe for us to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
him here with you?" Nathan asked, as if
undecided what course he ought to pursue.</p>

<p>"I'll answer for him with my life! Don't
think there is any chance of slipping up on the
work again, after all that's been in my mind
since he got away."</p>

<p>After a brief consultation the two lads concluded
it would be safe to leave the prisoner
with Abbott, particularly since Colonel
McDowells had so instructed them; and in less
than two hours from the time of leaving the
encampment, they were riding back at full
speed, hoping it might be possible to arrive before
the force had started on the march toward
King's Mountain.</p>

<p>And in this they were successful.</p>

<p>The soldiers were on the point of setting out
when the lads arrived, and the reception with
which they were met can well be imagined.</p>

<p>As soon as their story could be told, and it
was generally understood there was no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
any reason to fear that Ephraim Sowers might
carry information of their movements to Major
Ferguson, the command was in motion, with
Nathan and Evan riding either side of Colonel
McDowells.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>In the report of the battle, which is signed
by Colonel Benjamin Cleaveland, Colonel Isaac
Shelby, and Colonel William Campbell, is the
following account:</p>

<p>"We began our march with nine hundred of
the best men about eight o'clock the same evening,
and, marching all night, came up with the
enemy about three o'clock <span class="s08">P.M.</span> of the seventh,
who lay encamped on the top of King's Mountain,
twelve miles north of the Cherokee Ford,
in the confidence that they could not be forced
from so advantageous a post. Previous to the
attack, on our march, the following disposition
was made: Colonel Shelby's regiment formed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
column in the center, on the left; Colonel Campbell's
regiment another on the right, with part
of Colonel Cleaveland's regiment, headed in
front by Major Joseph Winston; and Colonel
Sevier's formed a large column on the right
wing. The other part of Colonel Cleaveland's
regiment, headed by Colonel Cleaveland himself,
and Colonel Williams' regiment, composed
the left wing. In this order we advanced, and
got within a quarter of a mile of the enemy
before we were discovered."</p>

<p>Evan and Nathan rode by the side of the latter's
uncle, and as Colonel Shelby's and Colonel
Cleaveland's regiments began the attack, they
were the first in action.</p>

<p>"I am growing timorous," Evan whispered to
Nathan as the troops began the ascent of the
hill, and the latter replied:</p>

<p>"A fellow who spends twenty-four hours in
walking, and twenty-four hours in riding, without
repose, can well be forgiven for losing some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
portion of his courage. My own knees are not
oversteady, and I am beginning to wonder
whether they will bear me out when we are
within range of British lead."</p>

<p>Five minutes later Major Ferguson's force
opened fire, and Colonel Isaac Shelby had no
cause to complain of the lads' behavior.</p>

<p>As Evan afterward admitted, he was hardly
conscious of what he did from the moment he
saw the first man fall.</p>

<p>One of the troopers reported to Colonel McDowells,
who asked concerning his son after the
engagement was at an end:</p>

<p>"The two boys fought side by side, and like
veteran soldiers. I saw them making their way
up the hill when the shot was flying around
them like hail, and it was as if neither realized
the peril, or, realizing it, as if he heeded not the
possibility that death might come at any instant.
Never faltering, they continued the ascent,
pressing close on Isaac Shelby's heels until they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
were the foremost, fighting hand to hand with
the Britishers.</p>

<p>"They were within a dozen feet of Colonel
Williams when he received his death wound,
and then the redcoats were pressing us so hotly
that no man dared step aside to aid the officer.
Yet these two went out of their course to give
him succor, and, finding that he was already
unconscious, pressed forward once more. I was
just behind them when we arrived at the spot
where Major Ferguson lay dead."</p>

<p>"Evan feared his courage might fail him
when in the heat of action," the colonel said
half to himself, and the trooper replied with
emphasis:</p>

<p>"It must have increased rather than failed,
colonel, for those two lads shamed many a man
of us during the hour and five minutes which
we spent grappling with the Britishers. Twice
were we forced to fall back; but they remained
in the front line, and each time when we rallied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
they were first to take the forward step. Not
until Colonel Depuyster hoisted the white flag
did I see them cease their efforts, and then, the
excitement being gone, it was as if both of them
collapsed, and little wonder, colonel, for if you
will stop to think, these lads spent forty-eight
hours riding and walking before going into as
hot an engagement as we in the Carolinas have
ever experienced."</p>

<p>The battle of King's Mountain came to an
end as the trooper had said, in one hour and
five minutes after it began, and when the American
forces were drawn up in line it was found
that of the nine hundred, only twenty were
killed; but more than five times that number
had been wounded.</p>

<p>Of the king's soldiers, four officers and fifteen
privates were killed, and thirty-five privates
seriously wounded. Eighteen officers and fifteen
privates were taken prisoners. Of the
Tories, five officers and two hundred and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
men were killed; one officer and one hundred
and twenty-seven men wounded, while forty-eight
officers and six hundred men were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>According to the official report of that engagement,
only twenty of Major Ferguson's
force escaped, and among that number, one&mdash;Ephraim
Sowers&mdash;could be accounted for as
already a prisoner in the hands of the Americans.</p>

<p>The historian, Lossing, writes regarding this
engagement:</p>

<p>"No battle during the war was more obstinately
contested than this; for the Americans
were greatly exasperated by the cruelty of the
Tories, and to the latter it was a question of
life or death. It was with difficulty that the
Americans, remembering Tarleton's cruelty at
Buford's defeat, could be restrained from
slaughter, even after quarter was asked.</p>

<p>"On the morning after the battle a court-martial
was held, and several of the Tory prisoners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
were found guilty of murder and other
high crimes and hanged. Colonel Cleaveland
had previously declared that if certain persons,
who were the chief marauders, and who had
forfeited their lives, should fall into his hands,
he would hang them. Ten of these men were
suspended upon a tulip tree, which is yet standing&mdash;a
venerable giant of the forest. This was
the closing scene of the battle on King's Mountain,
an event which completely crushed the
spirits of the Loyalists, and weakened, beyond
recovery, the royal power in the Carolinas. Intelligence
of the defeat of Ferguson destroyed
all Cornwallis' hopes of Tory aid. He instantly
left Charlotte, retrograded, and established his
camp at Winnsborough, in Fairfield District,
between the Wateree and Broad Rivers."</p>

<p>It was because of Sarah Dillard's ride that
the battle of King's Mountain became possible,
and consequently it was through her indirectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
that the royal power in the Carolinas was
"weakened beyond recovery."</p>

<p>In telling the story of her brave act, it has
been necessary to introduce the two lads who
bore so honorable a part in that brief campaign,
and also the Tory spy, but it is not possible
within the limits of this tale to follow the adventures
of the two young Americans who, before
the independence of the United States was
gained, made for themselves most enviable
records among most gallant men.</p>

<p>At some time in the future, when the reader
shall be ready to go into the more important
engagements with Evan and Nathan, a further
account of their deeds will be set down, and
then can be described all which Ephraim Sowers
finally did to clear his name of the taint which
had been put upon it by his own deeds.</p>

<p>It suffices now to say that the spy was held
as prisoner by Colonel McDowells for two
months or more, when, agreeably to his sworn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
promise that he would never do aught against
the cause of freedom, he was released with the
understanding that he should leave the Carolinas
forever.</p>

<p>Within one week after the battle of King's
Mountain Nathan and Evan were regularly enrolled
among the soldiers under Colonel Charles
McDowells' command, and when General Cornwallis
surrendered were among the troops who
had contributed to that officer's discomfiture.</p>

<p>It was on the day set for the formal surrender
at Yorktown when the two lads were
standing side by side in the ranks, that Evan
whispered to his comrade:</p>

<p>"Who ever dreamed on that night when
Ephraim Sowers lorded it over us at Captain
Dillard's home that we should stand here waiting
to see the proudest general among all the
Britishers give up his sword to the 'rebel' commander?"</p>

<p>"Do you know that this victory was really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
begun when Sarah Dillard rode over the mountain
trail to Greene's Spring, for from that
moment all General Cornwallis' power in the
South began to wane."</p>

old soldier, proud of his record, who had served the king in '58, and who
takes the lad, Isaac Rice, as his 'personal recruit.' The lad acquits
himself superbly. Col. Ethan Allen 'in the name of God and the continental

Benedict Arnold and numerous other famous historical names
appear in this dramatic tale."&mdash;<b>Boston Globe.</b></p>
